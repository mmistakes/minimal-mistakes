title: "Use of Generative AI for Fictional Field Studies in Design Courses"
# Keys must be unique to each paper, see section below for more details

# Papers are ordered by year. However, in years with many papers, we want some ordering at a lower level. You can do
# that by specifying an order for the papers of that year. For example, 2023-11 will put papers with values lower than
# 2023-11 below that paper. Notice that sorting is lexicographic.
order: 2024-20

# Include a shortened name for the journal or conference/proceedings.
# Generally go for the colloquial name here, so InfoVis, VIS, EuroVis, VAST, CHI, TVCG.
# Don't bother with publication format (CGF for EuroVis or TVCG for VIS papers).
# Don't mention organizations (IEEE, ACM), so VIS, not IEEE VIS, CHI, not ACM CHI.
# Do include relevant qualifiers, such as "Short Papers" (VIS Short Papers) or "Posters" (VIS Posters)
# Don't include a year, or a shorthand for the year, so NOT: InfoVis'14

abstract: "<p>
In this paper, we present how we used generative AI (GenAI) as a pedagogical tool for students taking a course in tangible interaction design. In this course, the students design different physical-digital objects (PDOs) to learn designing, sketching and prototyping with code and hardware. However, due to the short course duration these PDOs are not evaluated or explored with any kind of field or user study. Therefore we gave the students the exercise of doing user interviews with GenAI to explore their design ideas further. With this paper, we contribute a description and the outcomes of this approach, and highlight the pedagogical implications for student learning.
