# Papers are ordered by year. However, in years with many papers, we want some ordering at a lower level. You can do
# that by specifying an order for the papers of that year. For example, 2023-11 will put papers with values lower than
# 2023-11 below that paper. Notice that sorting is lexicographic.
# order: 2023-11
