abstract: "<p>In contemporary society, patterns of social interaction are undergoing profound transformations. Social connections, particularly those between strangers, have become increasingly mediated and less direct. This study explores how immersive installations can foster social connections—and even create temporary micro-communities—through storytelling, embodied experience, and multi-sensory engagement, oﬀering a way to counteract the sense of alienation in modern society.</p> <p>Drawing on the Research-through-Design approach, this study integrates field interviews, case studies, cultural probes, and an Embodied Storming workshop to develop an immersive installation inspired by Biophilia. The results show that through symbolic narratives rooted in the human-nature connection, the installation utilizes “co-breathing” as both an embodied, non-verbal medium and a multi-sensory trigger. This approach not only stimulates brief interactions among strangers but also enhances their emotional sense of togetherness.<p> <p>The immersive experience model developed in this study provides methodological support for designing interactive installations in public spaces that promote social connection.</p>"
