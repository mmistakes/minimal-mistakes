# Papers are ordered by year. However, in years with many papers, we want some ordering at a lower level. You can do
# that by specifying an order for the papers of that year. For example, 2023-11 will put papers with values lower than
# 2023-11 below that paper. Notice that sorting is lexicographic.
# order: 2023-11

# Don't bother with publication format (CGF for EuroVis or TVCG for VIS papers).
# Don't mention organizations (IEEE, ACM), so VIS, not IEEE VIS, CHI, not ACM CHI.
# Do include relevant qualifiers, such as "Short Papers" (VIS Short Papers) or "Posters" (VIS Posters)
# Don't include a year, or a shorthand for the year, so NOT: InfoVis'14

abstract: "<p>
The challenge of how cities can be designed and developed in an inclusive and sustainable direction is monumental. Smart city technologies currently offer the most promising solution for long-term sustainability, but the impact of such solutions will be significantly reduced without long-term, widespread adoption by citizens.
