abstract: "
<p>Visualization research methods help us study how visualization systems are used in complex real-world scenarios. One such widely used method is the interview — researchers asking participants specific questions to enrich their understanding. In this work, we introduce the pair-interview technique as a method that relies on two interviewers with specific and delineated roles, instead of one. Pair-interviewing focuses on the mechanics of conducting semistructured interviews as a pair, and complements other existing visualization interview techniques. Based on a synthesis of the experiences and reflections of researchers in four diverse studies who used pair-interviewing, we outline recommendations for when and how to use pair-interviewing within visualization research studies.</p>
