__Personal statement__   
With some effort, most people can find their way in a new city. But how they do that, remains something of a mystery. Presumably, earlier knowledge (consulting maps, asking strangers, quickly storing a spatial path, etc) is recombined in novel ways to get to your destination. In this sense, we can call this a partially novel task. The ability to perform such tasks is called cognitive control. 

My main interest is understanding the mechanisms of cognitive control, using behavioral, computational, and neural methods.

My current project studies how behavior becomes habitual and how habits can be overcome. I use computational modeling, fMRI, and brain stimulation techniques to investigate these questions.

My broader research interests are pretty varied and can be described as: finding out how humans think :). Before and during my PhD I studied the role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions such as language and cognition. In my postdoc at NIDA (NIH) I switched gears and learned more about addiction and reward processing. My present Fellowship integrates some of the key ideas behind reward processing, automaticity, and cognition.

My Fellowship is funded by the Flanders Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) and the European Commission’s Marie Curie Actions through the Pegasus scheme.

My research focuses on how reward and reward prediction errors (i.e., mismatches between reward outcome and reward expectation) influence declarative memory (e.g., learning a foreign language). Using a Dutch-Swahili word learning paradigm, we found that word pair recognition increases linearly with larger and more positive RPEs [(De Loof et al., 2018)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189212). We also found neural oscillatory signatures that confirm the experience of signed RPEs (SRPEs) boosting declarative memory [(Ergo et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918320676). My goal is to further investigate the robustness and generality of these findings. To study how RPEs influence declarative memory, I use both behavioral and EEG studies. Recently, I also became interested in neurostimulation techniques, such as tACS. My PhD is funded by the Flanders Fund for Scientific Research (FWO).

Outside of the lab, I enjoy hanging out with my dog Fellow, playing the guitar, karaoke, gaming and travelling.

In my Ph.D. project, we aim to take a fresh perspective that emphasizes the study of memory, in its natural dynamic setting, as a journey in the making. The two key characters in this journey are learning and consolidation: both processes are known to interact but have hitherto been studied in isolation. The perspective of this project enables them to be understood, for the first time, under the influence of their inherent interactions, and in the context of brain maturation and aging. The project aims to provide new insight into how much our ability to learn is dictated by the makeup of our neuronal circuitries, how memories are initially formed and later stored for the long haul, how this is made possible by the rewiring of our neuronal circuitries, and how our memory processes and capacities vary as our brain evolves through its lifespan. 

For this project I use mainly EEG and computational modeling. I like to perform my EEG analyses using Python's [mne software](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html). Computational modeling is something I try to achieve using Python 3. 

Outside my work I find joy in programming, mainly to solve mathematical riddles. Also, I like to learn more about the Python programming language in general. Code for my first and second passion can both be found on my personal GitHub.

I am currently in the final stages of my DPhil at Oxford University in the Summerfield lab. My work focuses on how information is structured and transformed in the brain during decision making, mainly using neurophysiological measures (EEG) and computational modelling. One line of research has looked at how structure (e.g. a line, circle, hierarchy, ...) is represented in the brain. For example we studied whether decisions about different categories with a shared underlying structure rely on the same neural signals [(Luyckx et al., eLife, 2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/42816). A different line of research has focused on the neural mechanisms of value-based decision making, specifically how neural patterns can shed a light on why we make economically "irrational" choices [(Luyckx et al., bioRxiv, 2019)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/642371v3).  

Outside of work, I like to torment the strings on my guitar or squash racket.
