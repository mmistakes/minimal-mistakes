* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments -- content first.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/404.html) to get you started.
