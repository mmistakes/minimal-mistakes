## Number Plate Detection System
This project aims to detect vehicles entering the campus of IIT Roorkee, recording the Number Plates for security purposes. The system tracks the vehicle and separates the number plate from the automobile and outputs the digits. This system has been implemented with a number of approaches and a lot of work is still needed to refine the whole pipeline. In this repo we are using Deep Learning techniques like YOLO for object detection and have also implemented OCR (using openCV).
