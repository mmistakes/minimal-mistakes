Nothing clever here :wink:. Layouts, data files, and includes are all placed in their default locations. Stylesheets and scripts in `assets`, and a few development related files in the project's root directory.

**Please note:** If you installed Minimal Mistakes via the Ruby Gem method, theme files like `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, and `/assets/` will be missing. This is normal as they are bundled with the [`minimal-mistakes-jekyll`](https://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll) Ruby gem.
