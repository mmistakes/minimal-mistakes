  "description" : "<p>This is a postdoc position to develop new *Salmonella* typing and
phenotype prediction methods from genomes and metagenomes using population
genomics and machine learning.  The project is novel in a number of ways. We will be using
graph representations to identify polymorphisms in ~250,000 genomes then use that information to train
disentangled variational autoencoders to create reduced representations of genome space and synthetic data for
training neural networks for phenotype prediction and antimicrobial resistance. The same data will
be used for active learning to train models for sanitizer resistance. Because of the genome size and the number of
genomes, Salmonella is a great system to develop new non-linear polygenic scoring models that could have a
 major impact on other areas of genomics.  Salmonellosis is also a serious disease that sickens 1 million  Americans
 a year and causes billions in economic losses. Improving methods of detection will help to reduce outbreaks.
</p>
<p>I anticipate that a successful applicant will have an interest or experience in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>computer science, machine learning, applied math, computational biology or bioinformatics.</li>
    <li>This position focuses on the development of applications for analysis
        of this data and the publication of software tools. A successful candidate will
        likely have some experience in version control, data structures, ML
        frameworks like Keras, Tensorflow, or PyTorch and proficiency in Python</li>
  <li>The applicant should have a good understanding of statistics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  I recognize that each person has a unique mix of experience and individual strengths and I encourage any
applicant with a strong record of research productivity and relevant experience
to apply, even if your mix of skills is different than what is listed above.</p>
<p>This is a federal government position and compensation includes competitive postdoctoral pay starting at $64,009 for
 GS-11 Step 1, Medical, Dental, TSP (401K-like plan with 5% employer match), FERS Pension. The position is fully
 funded for 4 years.</p>
<p>Due to funding restrictions, the position is only open to US citizens or permanent US residents seeking citizenship.</>
<p>The position is located in Gainesville, FL at the USDA Agricultural Research Service lab and the
 University of Florida Emerging Pathogens Institute. While relocation may ultimately be required the position could
 be started remotely due to the COVID19 maximum telework policy.</p><p>USDA/ARS is an equal opportunity provider and employer.</p>",
