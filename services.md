# Two ways we work: Planning & Results

We combine **advisory** that sets direction with **fractional leadership** that ships outcomes. Use either track—or both.

---

## Planning (Advisory)

**What it is:** Focused strategy work that clarifies priorities and path to value.  
**When to use:** You need a sharper plan before adding “more.”

**Typical engagements (4–8 weeks):**
- **Growth & Scale Plan:** from scattered initiatives to a single, prioritized plan.
- **Operating Model Design:** org, roles, cadences, portfolio governance.
- **Data & Systems Blueprint:** OKRs/KPIs, dashboards, source-of-truth design.
- **Security & Compliance Operating Model:** SOC 2/ISO 27001 cadence, risk register, vendor program, Trust Center structure.
- **Board/Investor Communications:** narrative, metrics, and update rhythm.

**Deliverables:** one-page strategy, 90-day plan, KPI set, governance cadence, exec brief.  
**Outcome:** Team alignment, faster decisions, a plan everyone actually uses.

## Results (Fractional Leadership)

**What it is:** Embedded leadership (CTO, CIO, COO, CISO) to execute with your team.  
**When to use:** You need experienced operators—without full-time overhead.

**Typical roles & focus:**
- **Fractional CTO/CIO:** delivery cadence, platform roadmap, analytics/data governance.
- **Fractional COO:** operating cadence, portfolio management, cost discipline (OpEx vs COGS vs R&D).
- **Fractional CISO:** policy set, secure SDLC, vulnerability & third-party risk, incident readiness.

**Engagement model:** 1–3 days/week, 8–24 weeks, clear exit to a self-sustaining system.  
**Outcome:** Measurable progress, institutionalized habits, and a team that keeps winning.
