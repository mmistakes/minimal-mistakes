## 1 - Probability and Statistics : From Classical to Bayesian  
* **Mentors:** Aniket Kumar (aniki#8797), Pranay Agarwal (Pranzer#5431), Munish Gupta (Alexios#2464)  
* **Description :** This Project will guide you through the basics of Probability Theory, data generation , decision theory , Bayesian Analysis and then application of Bayesian to real world problems.
The project would be of immense help to many as probability theory has wide applications ranging from its use in the corporate world to the realm of research in almost any field. Familiarity with probability theory helps theoreticians and experimentalists alike.  
* **Expected Duration :** 2 months  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment:** 4-5 hours  

## 2 - Communicating Mathematics  
* **Mentors:** Harshit Bisht (Harshit Bisht#7766)  
* **Description :** Disclaimer: This project will very likely be useless for both jobs and MS/PhD admissions. You have been warned.
Mathematical concepts are often disconnected from people's reality, people don't relate to statistics shared by politicians, economists, public organizations, and other domains that are relevant to everyday life. The project would aim to create examples, counterexamples, simulations, and games to connect math concepts to their relevance to the world at large.
Some arbitrary examples:

  - Law of large numbers and population statistics : A biased coin that lands H 99% of the time feels like it would never land tails, but if you flip it enough the sample distribution would converge to the true distribution. This is similar to if a country/society takes a 1% individual risk together, in a country of 1B more than 10M are affected.
  - Basic reproduction number (R0) and how to understand contagiousness of a disease.
  - Why do people talk about dummy candidates in elections? Are there election systems where no one has incentive to start dummy candidates (and what are the flaws of such systems?)

  Since this will a project of interest/love more than technical depth, the participating group can be decided based on how many people want to do this. Please note that unfortunately, this will be a project where your communication skills might be barrier, but please don't shy away from applying if you feel interested.  
* **Expected Duration :** 2-3 months  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment:** 5 hours  

## 3 - The Dynamics of Life  
* **Mentors:** Mohit Kulkarni (hairyballs#1384)  
* **Description :** In this course we wish to discover aspects of mathematics widely used in dynamical systems with application to biology. Nature has beautiful patterns as well as chaos, we wish to understand how dynamical systems work particularly in the brain. Initial weeks would cover basic biology and basic mathematics required thereafter. Here we will try to get an intuituon on why mathematics and biology aren't completely different areas. Later, we will understand what a network, what chaos is and why dynamics is important. We will look into one/two dimensional dynamical systems(would also include the dynamics of a neuron). Later topics will depend on you and may include RNN's, large-scale neural models, attractor dynamics etc. 

  Maths may be difficult to understand, so we will take the help of cool visualisations. Programming knowledge(any language) is a plus but not required.

  Some books we may refer to (Tentative)
  1. Mathematics of Life, Ian Stewart,
  2. Nonlinear dynamics and chaos, Steven Strogatz

## 9 - Counting is fun  
* **Mentors:** Farzan Byramji (geekotechy#7312)

  Depending on the interests and background of people, we can start by looking at standard things. If algebra is of interest, ideas from algebraic combinatorics can be explored.   For those who wish to focus on some specific sub-topic, one of various classes of objects like pattern-avoiding permutations, lattice paths, plane partitions, hyperplane   arrangements, etc. can be picked up. Computations using computer algebra have been very useful in this area, so that can also be a component.

We’ll present the rendering equation in its original form and introduce radiometry to see how the rendering equation captures most physical phenomena under the assumptions of geometric optics. We’ll then see why finding an analytical solution can be difficult, develop a naive algorithm and finally introduce Monte Carlo methods that modern renderers like Pixar’s RenderMan or Blender’s Cycles are based on.

  One component (the obvious one) is theoretical where the idea would be to cover theory (some Olympiad related and some algebra related) and tickle the brain cells by solving   some problems.

  The other component would be implementing some of the algorithms in code as we study them. This would give a more hands on feel and an idea about using it in applications.

## 14 - Generating rational distance sets on a parabola  
* **Mentors:** Sayak Bhattacharjee (saybha_00#0654)  
* **Description :** Introduction:
A rational distance set is a set of points with each of its pairwise distances to be rational. We study the problem of finding N-point rational distance sets on the parabola y = x^2. An open problem is to find the largest N for which a rational distance set exists on the parabola. While we know that N is finite, we do not yet know if even a 6-point rational distance set on the parabola exists!

  Reference: G. Campbell, Points on y = x^2 at rational distance, Math. Comp., 73 (2004), 2093–2108.

  Outline of project:
  1. Introduction to existing literature; explore a correspondence of the problem with Pythagorean triplets, and study existence and nature of the solutions for general N from a   linear algebraic point-of-view. 
  2. Primary goal: Attempt to obtain solutions computationally for N=4 and N=5 by building on techniques available for N=3. This will involve building time/space efficient   algorithms to efficiently search for solutions.
  3. Possible extension: Attempt to understand density of the solutions on the parabola for small N using real analysis.  

  Necessary pre-requisite knowledge: Linear algebra, basic combinatorics, Python/C.
  Not strictly necessary pre-requisite knowledge: Parallel computing, real analysis.  
* **Expected Duration :** about 2 months (min.)  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment:** 5+  

## 15 - Quantum Algorithms  
* **Mentors:** Rishabh Kothary (rishk76#7995)  
* **Description :** Quantum Algorithms is a hot research area, and quantum algorithms like Shor's factorization algorithm have threatened the current state-of-the-art cryptosystems like the RSA. Shor's algorithm has brought an exponential speedup to the integer factorization problem compared to its classical counterpart. It has forced the cryptography community to build cryptosystems resilient to attacks from quantum computers. Our main aim is to understand the quantum computation model and learn about Shor's factorization algorithm in the project. If time permits, we could explore algorithms like Grover's Search algorithm and Simon's Algorithm and their applications in breaking cryptosystems. Not many pre-requisites are assumed; a basic understanding of Linear Algebra should suffice. However, the pre-requisites are not very strict and can be covered during the project if interested.  
* **Expected Duration :** 2-3 months  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment:** 8-10 hrs  

## 16 - Introduction to Metric Spaces and Topology  
* **Mentors:** Kushlam Srivastava (Kuchlam#9851)  
* **Description :** This project is intended to be a brief introduction to Metric Spaces and Topology, an important tool which is very useful in Pure Mathematics and a bit of theoretical Physics as well. 
If you want a bit of motivation for this topic you can watch the following VSauce video which addresses the famous question ""How many holes does a straw have?"" through topology https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egEraZP9yXQ
We will first cover Metric Spaces which will be based on a lot of the first part of MTH101 and we can then move on topological concepts based on the comfort and understanding of the mentees.
Since most students are not able to do the course offered on Topology by MTH department before the 5th semester, this can be a great opportunity for you to learn this topic.
This project is mainly intended for Y20 students.  
* **Expected Duration :** 2 months  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment:** 5 hours  

## 17 - Understanding Graphs with Analysis  
* **Mentors:** Ayush Basu (abasu#5088)  
* **Description :** What are some nice ways to understand the handshake lemma? How many triangles does a tripartite graph contain? How can we count the number of subgraphs of a particular kind in a complete graph (or a random graph)? How can we define quasirandomness in graphs? How can we extend these notions to hypergraphs? 

  We will try and answer some of these questions in the project exploring counting techniques one can use for graphs and look at some of the famous conjectures of extremal graph   theory, a field primarily developed by Paul Erdös, one of the most prolific problem solvers to grace mathematics. 

  We will also focus on the theme of the dichotomy between structure and randomness and look at examples throughout our project that lead to a better understanding of these ideas. 

  Later on we may explore some advanced results in this field like the complete proof of Szemeredi's theorem and regularity Lemma.  
* **Expected Duration :** 2.5 months
