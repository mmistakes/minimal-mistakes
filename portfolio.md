## 📊 Project Highlights

---

### 1. 🧠 BCA Sentiment Analysis Using BERT

**Description:**  
Conducted sentiment analysis on user opinions regarding BCA’s mortgage product (KPR) using social media data from Twitter/X. Employed a pre-trained **BERT** model to classify sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) and uncover public perception trends.

**Technologies:**  
`Python`, `Transformers`, `BERT`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

**Key Points:**
- Contextual text preprocessing and sentiment classification
- Fine-tuning BERT for Indonesian language sentiment
- Weekly sentiment trends and topic-wise sentiment distribution

### 2. 🌐 Network Traffic Classification Using Flow-Based Features

**Description:**  
Developed a supervised machine learning model to classify network traffic protocols (e.g., HTTPS, FTP, SSH) using flow-based statistical features. The project focused on enhancing cybersecurity and efficient protocol identification.

**Technologies:**  
`Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `XGBoost`, `Random Forest`

**Key Points:**
- Feature extraction from packet flow (byte rate, packet count, flag ratios)
- Achieved high classification accuracy (≥90%)
- Identified top features contributing to protocol prediction

## 🚀 In Progress & Upcoming

- Interactive dashboard for BCA Sentiment Analysis using **Plotly & Dash**
- Real-time implementation of traffic classification based on socket log streaming
