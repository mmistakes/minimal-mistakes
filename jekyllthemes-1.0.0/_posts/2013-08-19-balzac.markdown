This is built on [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/) grid framework
which I edited a bit to make it fluid. It was forked from the wonderful
[Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
by Michael Rose.

I hope you enjoy using, forking, whatevering this theme as much as I
did making it.

### Features

* flexible, uses max-width for responsive goodness
* responsive drop down menu
* retina images using @2x
* post loop in the footer showing 3 latest post
* custom portfolio page for case studies
