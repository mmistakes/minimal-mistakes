Cool dark theme which looks nice on a desktop and on mobile devices.

It was forked from [Jekyll Clean theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-clean/)
modified a bit and 'darkified' with inspiration from
[Carte Noire theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/carte-noire/) colors.
Please feel free to check/use/share/modify this theme.

This theme supports:

 - [Disqus comments](http://disqus.com);
 - [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/);
 - [Yandex Metrika](http://metrica.yandex.com);
 - Blog tags.

It has some preinstalled social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow,
LastFm, Instagram). You can easily add more by putting .svg images in a
/css/social folder.
