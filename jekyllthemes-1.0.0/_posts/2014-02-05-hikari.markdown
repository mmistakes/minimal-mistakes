Hikari is an open-source [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme perfect
for bloggers and developers who want the best of both worlds: sharing
snippets and stories/pictures of their latest vacation in Tokyo (that's
just for the example, you may want to go to Kyoto too).

## Hikari is

- Simple & elegant
- Fluid & responsive
- Lightweight (no JS library has been abused during the development of
  this theme)
- & packed with syntax highlighting for you coders!
