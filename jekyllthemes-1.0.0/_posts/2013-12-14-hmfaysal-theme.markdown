A bold, minimal theme for Jekyll, perfect for bloggers. The theme
features the following and more:

* Responsive Circular Navigation uses CSS3 transforms for better
  performance in mobile devices.
* Responsive layout. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Calculation of post read-time based on word count.
* Readable typography to make your words shine. (Uses Electrolize and
  Abel from Adobe Edgefont)
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* Tags for Open Graph and Twitter Cards for a better social sharing
  experience.
* Vanilla custom 404 page to get you started.

Warm regards and stay creative,
Hossain Mohd Faysal
