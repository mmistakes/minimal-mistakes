## Getting started ##

If you're new to Jekyll, check out http://jekyllrb.com/ and read up on
Jekyll. It's worth it.

* [Another great resource to learn about Jekyll](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
* [Github's guide to using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)

If you run one of the latest versions of Jekyll, this theme will work
with no* problems.

### Installing ##

As simple as forking the repository, and then clone it so you can edit
the files locally.

### Configuration ###

Edit `_config.yml`!

You can find `_config.yml` in your site's root directory. This
configuration file contains some necessary settings and some optional
customization settings. **All settings are explained in `_config.yml`
itself.**

There are some customizations that can't be done in `_config.yml`.
These include:

* Editing the About, Contact and Archive page.
* Adding or removing pages from the navigation. This can be done in `\_includes\navigation.html`.
* The "thanks" page after a message has been send through the contact page: `thanks.md`
* The gradient on cover images: `\_includes\gradient.css` (this is explained in `_config.yml`).

Also make sure to replace the placeholder favicons and the
`\img\og-image.jpg` with your own.

### Start the Jekyll server ###

Run this command at the root of your site:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

> To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server,
> run Jekyll with Bundler. Use the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

When everything is OK, your site should now be available at
`http://localhost:4000`.

That's it.
