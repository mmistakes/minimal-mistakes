[Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo) is a Jekyll theme that supports
**single-page websites** only, but supports them well. Yes, it's
responsive.

Solo is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and
  host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like
  [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).
* You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist
  ([example](https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504)), but would like
  something nicer-looking.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page
  generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.
