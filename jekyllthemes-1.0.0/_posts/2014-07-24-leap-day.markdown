Open source content for Leap Day theme. Theme was first designed /
developed for GitHub Pages and is available for download, forking and
using anywhere else on the web. Like the theme share it with the
twitterverse.

### Developing Locally

I've worked hard to make develoment easy. Running `script/bootstrap`
will get your gems setup (Jekyll, Sass, Compass, Foreman), then you can
get started running `script/server` which will run `jekyll serve &&
compass --watch` commands via terminal. Open http://localhost:4000 and
make changes to any of the, md, .html or .scss files and compass will
compile them for you.

Simply refresh your browser (or use something like livereload) and
develop away. Most of the colors and sizing is found in the
_variables.scss file.
