## FAQ

**Do we need a full-time executive?**  
Maybe later. Fractional leadership gives you senior operators now—without full-time overhead.

**How fast will we see impact?**  
Most teams feel relief in 2–3 weeks; meaningful KPI movement in 6–12.

**What changes after you leave?**  
Nothing—and that’s the point. We build rhythms your team can run.

**Do you work outside tech/services?**  
We focus there because the patterns repeat and the leverage is highest.

**What does a typical engagement cost?**  
We scope flat-fee advisory (4–8 weeks) or fractional (1–3 days/week). We’ll price the smallest thing that moves the needle.
