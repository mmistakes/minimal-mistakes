Hello, I am Vinit and i work as a JS/Nodejs programmer in an awesome dutch company, Changer. 
I am in love with programming ever since i laid my hands on those sweet black and box magic machines with LOGO in it. I progressed from Logo to GWBasic to Java to Python, C, C++ and now i mostly program in JavaScript. I love the way programming and development has progressed and i can see it going well beyond.

I also like writing sometimes mostly on web, programming, development and technology. So if you have interest in these topics, i am sure you will find some of my writing interesting.

I also maintain another tech-blog named as [Gotchacode](http://gotchacode.com). It also have some interesting posts which i am sure you would like.
