# This is an example vagrant.yml YAML file that
# documents and defines the various fields and options
# of this configuration file for the Vagrant provisioner
# to use to create a (or multiple) virtual machines.

# name of the project (root name of machines)
project:

# specifies a list of configuration files to
# include and are required for this configuration
# file to be provisioned correctly. (default: [])
includes:

# specifies a primary machine. The primary machine will be the
# default machine used when a specific machine in a multi-
# machine environment is not specified. (optional)
primary:

# By default in a multi-machine environment, vagrant up will
# start all of the defined machines. The autostart setting
# allows you to tell Vagrant to not start any machines by
# default. Specific machines can override this setting.
autostart:

# map of mixins and the configurations for inclusion
# in the defined machines, used as encapsulation mechanism
# for functionality shared by machines but not inherited;
# allowing for better modularity.
mixins:

# map of (multiple) machines and the configurations
# for each of the machines.
