An enjoyable description of the twentieth century, told through Walter 
Cronkite's life experiences as well as his prominent journalistic pieces. 

Describing the incidents he reported on as a journalist many years ago, 
Cronkite also provides his personal opinions, a rarity during his lifelong 
tenure on the air. Viewing historical events through the lens of an 
experienced reporter, especially one as renowned as Cronkite for his integrity, 
provides a fascinating perspective.

Delivering all of the significant world events from the past 24 hours to an 
audience in a matter of 22 minutes was a daily problem for Cronkite when he 
anchored the CBS Evening News. He discusses having to balance what events 
mattered the most to and would have the biggest impact on viewers. It was a 
balancing act they experienced every day, finding and vetting the handful of 
stories they would present for 3-5 minutes each. Trying to deliver enough 
information in those moments to be valuable without turning into a string 
of soundbites. 

This problem resonates with me. I thoroughly enjoy reading various news 
sources, educational, and informational articles. It could easily take up 
hours of each day. Meanwhile, I have to balance that with living life. It's 
a constant challenge to limit my time consuming news and information versus 
all the other things I want to or should be doing.

Cronkite expounds on the evolution of news organizations from a culture of 
objective reporting into infotainment, driven by ratings and advertisement 
dollars. The number of competitive news organizations declined throughout 
his career, consolidating into the same parent companies or folding due to 
failing business models. The competitive dynamic in the early years 
contributed to the reporters and editors great desire for accuracy, always 
comparing their stories against their competitors as a means of verification. 
With that competition dwindling, Cronkite thought the following. 

> The result is a generation of reporters who have escaped the discipline 
of accuracy and have left the rest of us with newspapers just a little less 
reliable, in this regard at least, than they used to be.

Published in 1996, just as the internet was beginning its prolific journey 
and long before Barack Obama became president, Cronkite's biography describes 
scenarios containing many similarities with present day politics. In particular, 
the current interaction between President Trump and news outlets is eerily 
similar to the dynamics in post WWII Russia under Stalin and the Nixon 
administration's treatment of the press, both of which Cronkite experienced 
firsthand. 

While a foreign correspondent in Russia after World War II, he experienced the 
impact of government controlled media on the populace. Over a period of months, 
he describes how his personal driver's views slowly altered from independent 
opinions to regurgitating the propaganda published by the communist regime 
under Stalin. An example of how people can be worn down over time to believe 
that which they previously knew to be false, purely through repetition and 
limited access to an independent press. 

> He had been a driver in the Soviet army and, during our first months together, 
he spent most of our conversation time praising the American "zheep," as he 
called it. To his mind, the jeep was the greatest technical achievement of the 
twentieth century, and the Americans, in developing it, had proved their 
technical superiority. 
>
> But Alexander was undergoing the brainwashing that the Kremlin propaganda 
masters had directed to wipe out such impressions left by American aid during 
the war. The propaganda was vicious and persistent. One of their most heinous 
lies was that the British and American air forces had deliberately bombed the 
working-class quarters in Germany in order to rid the nation of those most 
likely to be sympathetic to the Soviet Union. 
>
> I thought surely that the people must find the official claims as ridiculous 
as I did. But I came to realize how effective lies can be when the truth is 
suppressed as I heard Alexander's tune change, day by day. Within months, he 
was asking me, plaintively and with genuine disappointment, why we Americans 
claimed to have invented the "zheep" when we knew the Russians had. 

During his years as the anchor of CBS Evening News, Cronkite covered the years 
Nixon held the Oval Office. His description of President Nixon and the 
administration's behaviors are obvious to us now, in retrospect, knowing what 
we do about the Watergate conspiracy. Yet we must remember that it was 
investigative journalism and the free press that broke open the criminal 
activity of the 37th President of the United States. 

> Nixon sat in the White House and thought he had the power to get even with 
the hated press. So he set his deputies on the job, and Vice President Spiro 
Agnew was named lead dog…. He identified the network news organizations as the 
main target in a speech that dripped with vitriol. 
> 
> The entire attack was predicated on a fundamental belief that there was a 
press conspiracy against the Nixon administration and all that was right and 
proper in the conservative world. 

This inflammatory attitude towards the independent press has resurfaced in our 
45th President, Donald Trump, with his frequent tweets and comments targeting 
specific news organizations and labeling the press the "enemy of the people." 
Using history as our guide, we must think critically and investigate the 
questions his behavior begs. The independent press must be allowed to continue 
its job as watchdogs of truth.

Throughout the book, it's obvious that Cronkite took his objectivity and 
integrity very seriously during his career. He would rarely provide short 
editorial pieces, claiming that other reporters, such as Andy Rooney, wrote 
or performed them with much more panache. Instead, he stuck to what he knew 
and loved, presenting the facts as he knew them. 

> My job was to try as hard as I could to remove every trace of opinion from 
the broadcast. If people knew how I felt on an issue, or thought they could 
discern from me some ideological position of the Columbia Broadcasting System, 
I had failed in my mission.
