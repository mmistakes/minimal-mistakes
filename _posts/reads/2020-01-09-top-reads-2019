In no particular order, these are some of my favorite books from my [2019 reading list](reading-list-2019).

[![Becoming by Michelle Obama](/images/cover_Becoming_MichelleObama_150.jpg "Becoming by Michelle Obama"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136/)

This is my favorite memoir. Michelle is a wonderful writer, telling her life story
through her lens, this is her perspective and she's unafraid to delve into the
depth of her experiences.

She touches on every subject you would expect from an intelligent, caring woman
born into a close-knit middle-class family in South Side Chicago. She holds herself
to the highest standards, evident in her years of success at Ivy League universities
and her career as a lawyer and community outreach advocate for different Chicago
institutions. Eventually, she gets pulled into the roller coaster ride of a lifetime
as FLOTUS and provides an inside look at the emotional and physical toll of
campaigning and politics...as well as all the positive experiences she relished.
Michelle provides insight into what her life, and her family's, was like as we all
watched (and judged) from the outside.

[![Blood for Blood by Victoria Selman](/images/cover_BloodForBlood_VictoriaSelman_150.jpg "Blood for Blood by Victoria Selman"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Blood-Ziba-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1503905055/)

I really enjoy the Ziba MacKenzie series by Victoria Selman (my type of mystery/suspense thriller):
[Blood for Blood](https://smile.amazon.com/Blood-Ziba-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1503905055/);
[Nothing to Lose](https://smile.amazon.com/Nothing-Lose-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1542041937/);
and [Snakes and Ladders](https://smile.amazon.com/Snakes-Ladders-MacKenzie-Victoria-Selman/dp/1542008794/).

The writing is engaging and succinct, the stories move at a swift pace, there are
more than a few surprising twists, and she explores the main character enough to
get to know and understand her a little better each time.

[![So you want to talk about race by Ijeoma Oluo](/images/cover_SoYouWantToTalkAboutRace_IjeomaOluo_150.jpg "So you want to talk about race by Ijeoma Oluo"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/You-Want-Talk-About-Race/dp/1580058825/)

Oluo covers many different aspects of racism and our actions that contribute
to the problem, such as microaggressions, tone policing, cultural appropriation,
school-to-prison pipeline, the "N" word, intersectionality, privilege, model
minority myth, and police brutality. She writes in a succint, clear, and direct
manner that enabled me to digest and understand these sensitive and charged topics.
Along with that, she conveys empathy for the reader, allowing us to feel our
discomfort, embrace it even, as part of the discussion.

SYWTTAR is an insightful book that will help you wrap your head around how to
discuss race, especially as a white person. For each chapter and topic, Oluo
suggests several actions you can take and real ways to make an impact. She
doesn't shy away from any areas of the race discussion, often framing them
around her own lived experiences. By drawing on her own life, she helps the
reader build empathy for her and the subject.

> Racism is any prejudice against someone because of their race, when those
views are reinforced by systems of power.

[![Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed by Men by Caroline Criado Perez](/images/cover_InvisibleWomen_CarolineCriadoPerez_150.jpg "Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed by Men by Caroline Criado Perez"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed/dp/1419735217/)

This is one of the (very few) books that completely blew my mind. The sheer
amount of research by the author is astounding. That she collated it into a
cohesive representation of how data bias impacts women is almost magical.
And that she is able to communicate it in an understandable and, dare I say,
entertaining manner is extraordinary.

After reading this book, everywhere I looked I would see ways in which our
society completely ignores womens needs. The author provides so many examples, with
data to stand behind them, that it's absolutely mind boggling...to men. Of
course, most women will read this and find themselves continually nodding
their heads in affirmation of what they've always known, or at least felt.

[![For the Love of Men: A New Vision for Mindful Masculinity by Liz Plank](/images/cover_ForTheLoveOfMen_LizPlank_150.jpg "For the Love of Men: A New Vision for Mindful Masculinity by Liz Plank"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Love-Men-Vision-Mindful-Masculinity/dp/1250196248/)

The author conveys an atypical perspective on feminism, geared more towards men
than women, but results in advancing equality for all genders. 

Liz Plank takes the stereotypical concept of masculinity and turns it upside down.
What if men are the ones who benefit the most by redefining masculinity? Liz delves
into the details of how men define masculinity and what they think of society’s
expectations. She advocates for and describes how men can embrace the concept of
"mindful masculinity" to improve their own lives by altering societal expectations.
Gift this book to all of the men in your life!

[![The Testaments by Margaret Atwood](/images/cover_TheTestaments_MargaretAtwood_150.jpg "The Testaments by Margaret Atwood"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Testaments-Novel-Margaret-Atwood/dp/0593149092/)

An amazing follow up to 1985's [The Handmaid's Tale](https://smile.amazon.com/The-Handmaids-Tale/dp/3125776929/).
The story moves along swiftly while thoroughly addressing so many of the open questions from its prequel.

[![The Power by Naomi Alderman](/images/cover_ThePower_NaomiAlderman_150.jpg "The Power by Naomi Alderman"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Power-Naomi-Alderman/dp/0316547603/)

I stumbled across this while perusing [Elliot Bay Book Company](https://www.elliottbaybook.com/)
and later discovered it was on
[President Obama's 2017 book list](https://time.com/5082975/barack-obama-2017-book-music-list/).
He was right, this was an entertaining story that I enjoyed tremendously.
In the same genre as The Handmaid's Tale, it's not quite a dystopian novel,
but does deal with how women are expected to behave in our society.
What do you think would happen if the stereotypical gender roles were
suddenly reversed?

[![Saga by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples](/images/cover_Saga_BrianVaughan_FionaStaples_150.jpg "Saga by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples"){: .align-left }](https://smile.amazon.com/Saga-Vol-1-Brian-Vaughan/dp/1607066017/)

A creative new spin on a tale as old as time...lovers caught in the crossfire of war.
The art is beautifully drawn and colored. The story is engaging and unique with the
thread of familiarity that allows us to easily relate.
