[![Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua](/images/cover_BattleHymnOfTheTigerMother_AmyChua_200.jpg "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua"){: .align-right }](https://smile.amazon.com/Battle-Hymn-Tiger-Mother-Chua/dp/0143120581/)

This was a thought-provoking read. [Amy Chua](http://amychua.com) describes 
the starkly contrasting differences between her parenting style, dubbed 
_Chinese parenting_, and that of most Americans. Her writing is approachable 
and often entertaining, even when I found myself cringing at her methods. But 
then, this is exactly what she wanted; to entertain the reader not instruct.

Chua tells her story chronologically, beginning with her own childhood as a 
daughter of Chinese immigrants for some background. She quickly moves to the 
birth of her first daughter and ends the story in 2010, right up to the point 
she finishes writing and her two daughters are teenagers. As time passes, we 
experience the lives of her daughters, husband, and family through her 
perspective. Major milestones and personal events are discussed with an 
openness that surprised me. In the beginning, she embraces her parenting style 
completely, without hesitance, and even with a bit of arrogance. This changes 
as her story unfolds, as noted on the book cover.

> This was _supposed_ to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at 
  raising kids than Western ones.
> 
> But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of 
  glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old.

There are three things that struck me about her story. 
-   She dedicated so much of her time and energy to teaching her daughters 
    during their childhood. 
-   The extreme methods she used in parenting, at least to my American 
    philosophy. 
-   That she was able to accomplish so much for herself during that same time. 

## Time and energy ##

The time and energy devoted to Sophia and Lulu, her two daughters, is beyond 
commendable. Actively participating in their music education by taking notes 
during lessons, researching various techniques to determine which was best, 
and learning enough to coach them herself during hours of practice every 
single day. 

That's right, each of her daughters practiced their instrument for multiple 
hours every single day, in addition to maintaining straight A's in school. 
During vacations, she would find local places with a piano for Sophia to play. 
For several years, she would drive them to the best teachers available, even 
though it meant spending several hours on the road every Saturday or Sunday. 

And that doesn't count the time she spent helping them with schoolwork or 
other interests. That's not to say she parented alone, her husband, Jed, was 
present and active as well. Chua clarifies that she was the driver behind the 
hours of music practice while he focused on other areas of the daughters and 
family.

## Parenting methods ##

I truly appreciate Chua's openness and honesty in describing her parenting 
methods. The battles, screaming, belittling, and coercion techniques used with 
her daughters are extreme, in my opinion. Of course, this is the gist of the 
book; comparing her _Chinese parenting_ style to Western (American) methods. 

It was interesting to read about her encounters, how she handled the parenting 
scenarios we've all seen, and the many discussions, even arguments, with her 
husband, Jed. While they always presented a united front to their daughters, 
he often voiced his concerns behind closed doors. I appreciate knowing her 
husband's perspective and that they worked through the disagreements. 

Seeing what her parenting experience has been like gave me insight into how it 
shapes not only the children but the parents. Especially when doing so in 
America, where parenting expectations are different from her experience as the 
child of Chinese immigrants. She felt the constant pressure to conform to 
Western standards by friends and parents, yet maintained her stance for a very 
long time.

## Her accomplishments ##

After reading about all the time and energy devoted to her two daughters, it 
dumbfounds me how she also found time to be a [Yale law professor](https://law.yale.edu/amy-chua), 
[write four books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Chua#Bibliography) (so 
far), do all the other things we need to do to get by in this world, and, oh 
yeah, get some sleep too. It's like she packed 36 hours into each day. I 
suddenly feel very lazy.

> Chinese parenting is one of the most difficult things I can think of. You 
  have to be hated sometimes by someone you love and who hopefully loves you, 
  and there's just no letting up, no point at which it suddenly becomes easy. 

While the book raised controversy with the press and readers, initially 
painting Chua as _that scary, harsh Chinese mom everyone's talking about_, 
it's obvious to me that she used herself as a lesson to other parents. Teach 
your children to work hard, always give their best effort, don't give up when 
it gets difficult, and do what you enjoy. That last part might not be obvious, 
but in the end, she supported and encouraged her daughters to pursue what they 
enjoy with passion and vigor.

The same advice applies to parents, be prepared to do everything you can for 
your children to prepare them for adult life in our world. Along with that, 
learn from Chua's own epiphany. Be aware of the relationship with your child 
and recognize the right time to let them make their own decisions. 
**Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom** is well worth the read for any parent. 

Lastly, read 18-year-old Sophia's response to the criticism of her mother's 
parenting methods, [Why I Love My Strict Chinese Mom](http://nypost.com/2011/01/18/why-i-love-my-strict-chinese-mom/). 
I only see evidence of her love and admiration for her mother, who taught her 
to be everything she could be in life.
