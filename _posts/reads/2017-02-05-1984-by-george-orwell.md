# Thoughts #

A classic novel by George Orwell (Eric Arthur Blair), it portrays the gradual 
evolution of the 1940's world as we knew it into a dystopian society of 1984. 
With a romance thrown in to pin the story to humanity's most precious emotion, 
love, this is a telling tale of what happens when we, the people who make up 
society, lose our ability to think critically and act with free will. Consider 
it fair warning to those who believe in or vote for despots, wanna-be-dictators, 
or oligarchies in the making. 

# Quotes #

>  From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big 
   Brother, from the age of doublethink&mdash;greetings!

>  It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage 
   is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got 
   rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After 
   all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some 
   other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take "good", for instance. 
   If you have a word like "good", what need is there for a word like "bad"? "Ungood" 
   will do just as well&mdash;better, because it's an exact opposite, which the 
   other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of "good", what sense is 
   there in having a whole string of vague useless words like "excellent" and 
   "splendid" and all the rest of them? "Plusgood" covers the meaning; or 
   "doubleplusgood" if you want something stronger still. 

>  Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have 
   rebelled they cannot become conscious. 

>  In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would 
   have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner 
   or later: the logic of their position demanded it. 

>  Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, 
   all else follows. 

>  From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all 
   thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefor to a great 
   extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used, 
   deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy and disease 
   could be eliminated within a few generations. 

>  But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the 
   destruction&mdash;indeed, in some sense was the destruction&mdash;of a 
   hierarchical society. 

>  For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of 
   human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and 
   would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they 
   would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, 
   and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was 
   only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance. 

>  In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is 
   waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the 
   war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the 
   structure of society intact. 

>  The aims of the three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the 
   High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places 
   with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim&mdash;for it is an 
   abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery 
   to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily 
   lives&mdash;is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all 
   men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in 
   its main outlines recurs over and over again. 

>  There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. Either 
   it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses 
   are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group 
   to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to 
   govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them 
   are present in some degree. 

When discussing how an oligarchy works using _doublethink_:

>  To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any 
   fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary 
   again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to 
   deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account 
   of the reality which one denies&mdash;all this is indispensably necessary. 

>  It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are 
   those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental 
   cheating. In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is 
   happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. 
   In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion: the 
   more intelligent, the less sane. 

>  If human equality is to be for ever averted&mdash;if the High, as we have 
   called them, are to keep their places permanently&mdash;then the prevailing 
   mental condition must be controlled insanity. 

>  Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual 
   mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the 
   mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party 
   holds to be truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by 
   looking through the eyes of the Party. 

>  Can you not understand, Winston, the individual is only a cell? The 
   weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you die when you 
   cut your fingernails? 

>  Power is inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds 
   to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. 
   Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the 
   exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers 
   imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling 
   and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless 
   as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. 

>  Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation 
   of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, 
   imagine a boot stamping on a human face&mdash;for ever.
