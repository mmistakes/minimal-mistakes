## Introduction
Convictional logs everything we do so that you can reference it if you need to prove something did or did not happen in the system. Understanding logs is important to make sure you and your trading partners have a good experience using the Convictional platform.

## How Logs Work
Every time a record is added, edited or deleted from Convictional, it will be recorded under logs. The logs are sorted by day and time and contain useful information about what happened. Right now we include the specific item that was modified and the action that was performed. 

## Use Cases
If your trading partner wants to verify that something made it to you (and order for example) you can go to the logs section of the admin. Alternatively you can use our API to pull down logs from a particular period and then store them in an Excel file. This is optional, but good practice.
