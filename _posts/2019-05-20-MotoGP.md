This year’s Grand Prix of the Americas in Austin was something of a spectacle. The Moto2 and Moto3 races were scrappy, and a technical issue saw Honda’s Marquez, who had been unassailable all weekend, out after a slide at Turn 12. Alex Rins and Suzuki would pick up the win, despite some tense moments with Rossi.  

These bikes sound and smell like fighter jets, and I was fascinated by the movement of the riders as they balance these machines. While their body lean into corners was an impressive physical feat, I think the balance out of the turn is more interesting. Notice in some of our shots coming out of Turn 20, there’s space between the asphalt and the front tire.

 Of course, not all riders raise the tire out of the turn, so there must be some optimization going on. Since only the back tire is connected to the drive train, it's obvious that too much throttle could flip the bike. Not enough throttle, and your straight-line acceleration is reduced. The fastest rider will apply maximum throttle, without loosing front tire contact. 

Simple enough. However, MotoGP bikes have an anti-wheelie (AW) feature. In the past, teams could independently develop their own AW programs, tuned to the rider, track, and setup. To keep smaller teams competitive, the MotoGP governing body dictated that everyone now gets the same bare bones software for their bike. This makes me a little crazy, but we’ll save that rant for another day. Bradley Smith of Gresini sums up the implications of this common software nicely.

>The wheelie control is probably the biggest drop from 2015. Now it only works when we get to zero on fork travel. Before we could offset the wheelie control, so it would start working before the forks topped out. It knew the wheelie was coming, so it was a very progressive system and we had better hover with the front wheel. Now it waits for the forks to top out and then the butterflies cut all the power. In the end you have to roll off because the butterflies cut so much power, then open again and the front comes down and so on, so you’re better to hold it yourself with the throttle.

In short, the software detects the tire has fully risen off the ground, and then limits some of your power input. Notice, that even with the AW software, **drivers can still wheelie**. That’s how much power these bikes have. Drivers mainly rely on forearm strength and front winglets to keep as much force on the front wheel as possible. Some teams have tested [other clever mechanisms](https://www.cycleworld.com/motogp-racing-winglets-anti-wheelie-technology-examined/) to add a little force on the nose, with limited success. 

All of this happens in less than five seconds. It’s one of many situations in racing where the dynamics, software, and human all come together, which is why this sport is so neat. For now, I’ll have to wait for Formula 1 to come back in November.
