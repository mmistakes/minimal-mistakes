# Objective

- PL/SQL and application programming
- Application models
- How to locate Oracle resources
- SQL and PL/SQL tools
- The databases used in this book
- SQL SELECT statement and data manipulation syntax

<br>

# Procedural Languages

- Programming languages allow actions of the end user to be converted to computer instructions
- Procedural languages allow the inclusion of logic processes
- PL/SQL is a procedural language, SQL is not a procedural language

<br>

# Application Programming

Example application screen

# Brewbean’s Application

Processing needed to support the shopping cart check out button:

- Verify quantities are > 0
- Calculate shipping cost
- Calculate taxes
- Check/update product inventory
- Check shopper profile for credit card information

<br>

# The PL/SQL Language

- Proprietary Oracle language
- Tightly integrated with SQL
- Can increase performance by grouping statements into blocks of code
- Portable to any Oracle platform
- Used within many Oracle tools
- Stored program units can increase security

<br>

# Application Models

- Three main components
  : - User interface or screens
  : - Program logic (brains behind the screens)
  : - Database
- Most models are based on a two- or three-tier structure

<br>

# Two-tier Model

- Commonly referred to as client/server
- Parts of the processing occur both on the user’s computer and the database server
- Named or stored program units are blocks of PL/SQL code saved in the Oracle database to provide server-side processing

<br>

# Two-tier Diagram

<br>

# Three-tier Model

- Thin client with no code loaded on the user machine (browser access)
- Middle tier is the application server – Forms server for Oracle
- Last tier is the database server
- Processing load is on the middle and last tier
- Maintenance is simplified

<br>
