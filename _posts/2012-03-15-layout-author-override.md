excerpt: "A post to test author overrides using a data file."

For those of you who may have content written by multiple authors on your site you can now assign different authors to each post if desired.

Previously the theme used a global author for the entire site and those attributes would be used in all bylines, social networking links, Twitter Card attribution, and Google Authorship. These `owner` variables were defined in `config.yml`

Start by modifying or creating a new `authors.yml` file in the `_data` folder and add your authors using the following format.

```yaml
# /_data/authors.yml

Billy Rick:
  name: Billy Rick
  uri: http://thewhip.com
  email: billy@rick.com
  bio: "What do you want, jewels? I am a very extravagant man."
  avatar: bio-photo-2.jpg
  twitter: extravagantman

Cornelius Fiddlebone:
  name: Cornelius Fiddlebone
  email: cornelius@thewhip.com
  bio: "I ordered what?"
  avatar: bio-photo.jpg
  twitter: rhymeswithsackit
```

To assign Billy Rick as an author for our post. You'd add the following YAML front matter to a post:

```yaml
author: Billy Rick
```
