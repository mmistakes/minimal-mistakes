# Purpose of Joins

- Joins are used to link tables and reconstruct data in a relational database
- Joins can be created through:
  : - Conditions in a WHERE clause
  : - Use of JOIN keywords in FROM clause

<br>

# Cartesian Joins

- Created by omitting joining condition in the WHERE clause or through CROSS JOIN keywords in the FROM clause
- Results in every possible row combination `(m * n)`

## Cartesian Join Example - Omitted Condition

```
-- PARTIAL OUTPUT SHOWN
SELECT TITLE, NAME
  FROM BOOKS, PUBLISHER;
```

## Cartesian Join Example - CROSS JOIN keywords

```
-- PARTIAL OUTPUT SHOWN
SELECT ISBN, TITLE, LOCATION, '     ', COUNT
  FROM BOOKS, WAREHOUSES
  ORDER BY LOCATION, TITLE;
```

<br>

# Equality Joins

- Link rows through equivalent data that exists in both tables
- Created by:
  : - Creating equivalency condition in the WHERE clause
  : - Using NATURAL JOIN, JOIN…USING, or JOIN...ON keywords in the FROM clause

## Equality Joins - WHERE Clause Example

```
SELECT TITLE, NAME
  FROM BOOKS, PUBLISHER
  WHERE BOOKS.PUBID = PUBLISHER.PUBID;
```

<br>

# Qualifying Column Names

Columns in both tables must be qualified

```
SELECT TITLE, PUBID, NAME
  FROM BOOKS, PUBLISHER
  WHERE BOOKS.PUBID = PUBLISHER.PUBID;
--> column ambiguously defined error occurred!
```

## WHERE Clause Supports Join and Other Conditions

```
SELECT TITLE, BOOKS.PUBID, NAME
  FROM BOOKS, PUBLISHER
  WHERE BOOKS.PUBID = PUBLISHER.PUBID
    AND PUBLISHER.PUBID = 4;
```

<br>

# Joining More Than Two Tables

Joining four tables requires three join conditions

## Equality Joins - NATURAL JOIN

```
SELECT TITLE, P.PUBID, NAME
  FROM PUBLISHER NATURAL JOIN BOOKS;
```

## No Qualifiers with a NATURAL JOIN

```
SELECT TITLE, P.PUBID, NAME
  FROM PUBLISHER NATURAL JOIN BOOKS;
--> "P", "PUBID": invalid identifier error occurred!
```

## Equality Joins - JOIN ...USING

```
SELECT B.TITLE, PUBID, P.NAME
  FROM PUBLISHER P JOIN BOOKS B
    USING (PUBID);
```

## Equality Joins - JOIN ...ON

```
SELECT B.TITLE, B.PUBID, P.NAME
  FROM PUBLISHER P JOIN BOOKS B
    ON P.ID = B.PUBID;
```

<br>

# JOIN Keyword Overview

- Use JOIN...USING when tables have one or more columns in common
- Use JOIN...ON when same named columns are not involved or a condition is needed to specify a relationship other than equivalency (next section)
- Using the JOIN keyword frees the WHERE clause for exclusive use in restricting rows

<br>

# Non-Equality Joins

- In WHERE clause, use any comparison operator other than the equal sign
- In FROM clause, use JOIN...ON keywords with a non-equivalent condition

## Equality Joins - WHERE Clause Example

```
SELECT B.TITLE, P.GIFT
  FROM BOOKS B, PROMOTION P
  WHERE B.RETAIL BETWEEN P.MINRETAIL AND P.MAXRETAIL;
```

## Non-Equality Joins - JOIN ...ON Example

```
SELECT B.TITLE, P.GIFT
  FROM BOOKS B JOIN PROMOTION P
    ON B.RETAIL BETWEEN P.MINRETAIL AND P.MAXRETAIL;
```

<br>

# Self-Joins

- Used to link a table to itself
- Requires the use of table aliases
- Requires the use of a column qualifier

## Customer Table Example

![img](../../assets/images/customer%20table.png)

## Self Joins - WHERE Clause Example

```
SELECT R.FIRSTNAME, R.LASTNAME, C.LASTNAME "REFERRED"
  FROM CUSTOMERS C, CUSTOMERS R
  WHERE C.REFERRED = R.CUSTOMER#;
```

## Self Joins - JOIN ...ON Example

```
SELECT R.FIRSTNAME, R.LASTNAME, C.LASTNAME "REFERRED"
  FROM CUSTOMERS C JOIN CUSTOMERS R
    ON C.REFERRED = R.CUSTOMER#;
```

<br>

# Outer Joins

- Use outer joins to include rows that do not have a match in the other table
- In WHERE clause, include outer join operator `(+)` immediately after the column name of the table with missing rows to add NULL rows
- In FROM clause, use FULL, LEFT, or RIGHT with OUTER JOIN keywords

## Outer Joins - WHERE Clause Example

```
SELECT C.LASTNAME, C.FIRSTNAME, O.ORDER#
  FROM CUSTOMERS C, ORDERS O
  WHERE C.CUSTOMER# = O.CUSTOMER#
  ORDER BY C.LASTNAME, C.FIRSTNAME;
```

## Outer Joins - OUTER JOIN Keyword Example

```
SELECT C.LASTNAME, C.FIRSTNAME, O.ORDER#
  FROM CUSTOMERS C, ORDERS O
  WHERE C.CUSTOMER# = O.CUSTOMER#(+)
  ORDER BY C.LASTNAME, C.FIRSTNAME;
```

If multiple join conditions are used, the outer join condition may be required in all of the join conditions to retain non-matching rows

In previous versions of Oracle an error would be raised if the outer join operator is used on the same table in more than one join operation

<br>

# Set Operators

Used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements

| Set Operator | Description                                                                                |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UNION        | Returns the results of both queries and removes duplicates                                 |
| UNION ALL    | Returns the results of both queries but includes duplicates                                |
| INTERSECT    | Returns only the rows included in the results of both queries                              |
| MINUS        | Subtracts the second query's results if they're also returned in the first query's results |

## Set Operators - UNION Example

```
SELECT BA.AUTHORID
  FROM BOOKS B JOIN BOOKAUTHOR BA
    USING (ISBN)
  WHERE CATEGORY = 'FAMILY LIFE'
UNION
SELECT BA.AUTHORID
  FROM BOOKS B JOIN BOOKAUTHOR BA
    USING (ISBN)
  WHERE CATEGORY = 'CHILDREN';
```

## Set Operators - INTERSECT Example

```
SELECT CUSTOMER#
  FROM CUSTOMERS
INTERSECT
SELECT CUSTOMER#
  FROM ORDERS;
```

## Set Operators - MINUS Example

```
SELECT CUSTOMER#
  FROM CUSTOMERS
MINUS
SELECT CUSTOMER#
  FROM ORDERS;
```

<br>

# Summary

- Data stored in multiple tables regarding a single entity can be linked together through the use of joins
- A Cartesian join between two tables returns every possible combination of rows from the tables; the resulting number of rows is always `m * n`
- An equality join is created when the data joining the records from two different tables are an exact match
- A non-equality join establishes a relationship based upon anything other than an equal condition
- Self-joins are used when a table must be joined to itself to retrieve needed data
- Inner joins are categorized as being equality, non-equality, or self-joins
- An outer join is created when records need to be included in the results without having corresponding records in the join tables
- The record is matched with a NULL record so it will be included in the output
- Set operators such as UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and MINUS can be used to combine the results of multiple queries
