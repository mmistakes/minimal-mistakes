# WHERE Clause Syntax

- A WHERE clause is used to retrieve rows based on a stated condition
- Requires:
  : - Column name
  : - Comparison operator
  : - Value or column for comparison
- Values are case sensitive

## WHERE Clause Example

- List WHERE clause after FROM clause
- Enclose nonnumeric data in single quotes

```
SELECT LASTNAME, STATE
  FROM CUSTOMERS
  WHERE STATE = 'FL';
```

<br>

# Comparison Operators

Indicate how the data should relate to the given search value

```
SELECT TITLE, RETAIL
  FROM BOOKS
  WHERE RETAIL > 55;
```

## Arithmetic Comparison Operators

| Operator     | Description                                                                         |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `=`          | Equality or "equal to" ─ for example, cost `=` 55.95                                |
| `<`          | Greater than ─ for example, cost `>` 20                                             |
| `>`          | Less than ─ for example, cost `<` 20                                                |
| `<>, !=, ^=` | Not equal to ─ for example, cost `<>` 55.95, or cost `!=` 55.95, or cost `^=` 55.95 |
| `<=`         | Less than or equal to ─ for example, cost `<=` 20                                   |
| `>=`         | Greater than or equal to ─ for example, cost `>=` 20                                |

## Other Comparison Operators

| Operator                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[NOT] BETWEEN x AND y` | Used to express a range — for example, searching for numbers BETWEEN 5 AND 10. The optional NOT is used when searching for numbers that are NOT BETWEEN 5 AND 10.                                                                                                                                         |
| `[NOT] IN (x,y,...)`    | Similar to the OR logical operator. Can search for records meeting at least one condition inside the parentheses — for example, Pubid IN (1, 4, 5) returns only books with a publisher ID of 1, 4, or 5. The optional NOT keyword instructs Oracle to return books not published by Publisher 1, 4, or 5. |
| `[NOT] LIKE`            | Used when searching for patterns if you aren’t certain how something is spelled — for example, title LIKE 'TH%'. Using the optional NOT means records that do contain the specified pattern shouldn’t be included in the results.                                                                         |
| `IS [NOT] NULL`         | Used to search for records that don’t have an entry in the specified field — for example, Shipdate IS NULL. Include the optional NOT to find records that do have an entry in the field — for example, Shipdate IS NOT NULL.                                                                              |

### 1. BETWEEN...AND Operator

- Finds values in a specified range

```
SELECT TITLE, PUBID
  FROM BOOKS
  WHERE PUBID BETWEEN 1 AND 3;
```

### 2. IN Operator

- Returns records that match a value in a specified list
- List must be in parentheses
- Values are separated by commas

```
SELECT TITLE, PUBID
  FROM BOOKS
  WHERE PUBID IN (1,2,5);
```

### 3. LIKE Operator

- Performs pattern searches
- Used with wildcard characters
  : - Underscore `(_)` for exactly one character in the indicated position
  : - Percent sign `(%)` represents any number of characters

```
SELECT LASTNAME
  FROM CUSTOMERS
  WHERE LASTNAME LIKE 'P%';
```

<br>

# Logical Operators

- Used to combine conditions
- Evaluated in order of NOT, AND, OR
  : - NOT – reverses meaning
  : - AND – both conditions must be TRUE
  : - OR – at least one condition must be TRUE

## AND Logical Operator Example

```
SELECT TITLE, PUBID, CATEGORY
  FROM BOOKS
  WHERE PUBID = 3 AND CATEGORY = 'COMPUTER';
```

## OR Logical Operator Example

```
SELECT TITLE, PUBID, CATEGORY
  FROM BOOKS
  WHERE PUBID = 3 OR CATEGORY = 'COMPUTER';
```

## Multiple Logical Operators

Resolved in order of NOT, AND, OR:

```
SELECT *
  FROM BOOKS
  WHERE CATEGORY = 'FAMILY LIFE'
    OR PUBID = 4
    AND COST > 15;
```

Use parentheses to override the order of evaluation:

```
SELECT *
  FROM BOOKS
  WHERE (CATEGORY = 'FAMILY LIFE'
    OR PUBID = 4)
    AND COST > 15;
```

<br>

# Resolving Multiple Types of Operators

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Logical operators

<br>

# Treatment of NULL Values

- Absence of data
- Requires use of IS NULL operator

```
SELECT ORDER#, SHIPDATE
  FROM ORDERS
  WHERE SHIPDATE IS NULL;
```

A common error is using = NULL, which does not raise an Oracle error but also does not return any rows:

```
SELECT ORDER#, SHIPDATE
  FROM ORDERS
  WHERE SHIPDATE = NULL;
```

<br>

# ORDER BY Clause Syntax

- The ORDER BY clause presents data in sorted order
- Ascending order is default
- Use DESC keyword to override column default
- 255 columns maximum

## ORDER BY Clause Syntax Sort Sequence

- In ascending order, values will be listed in the following sequence:
  : - Numeric values
  : - Character values
  : - NULL values

In descending order, sequence is reversed:

```
SELECT LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, STATE, CITY
  FROM CUSTOMERS
  WHERE STATE IN ('FL', 'CA')
  ORDER BY STATE DESC, CITY;
```

ORDER BY can reference column position:

```
SELECT LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, STATE, CITY
  FROM CUSTOMERS
  WHERE STATE IN ('FL', 'CA')
  ORDER BY 3 DESC, 4;
```

<br>

# Summary

- The WHERE clause can be included in a SELECT statement to restrict the rows returned by a query to only those meeting a specified condition
- When searching a nonnumeric field, the search values must be enclosed in single quotation marks
- Comparison operators are used to indicate how the record should relate to the search value
- The BETWEEN...AND comparison operator is used to search for records that fall within a certain range of values
- The LIKE comparison operator is used with the percent and underscore symbols (`%` and `_`) to establish search patterns
- Logical operators such as AND and OR can be used to combine several search conditions
- When using the AND operator, all conditions must be TRUE for a record to be returned in the results
  : However, with the OR operator, only one condition must be TRUE
- A NULL value is the absence of data, not a field with a blank space entered
- Use the IS NULL comparison operator to match NULL values; the IS NOT NULL comparison operator finds records that do not contain NULL values in the indicated column
- You can sort the results of queries by using an ORDER BY clause; when used, the ORDER BY clause should be listed last in the SELECT statement
- By default, records are sorted in ascending order; entering DESC directly after the column name sorts the records in descending order
- A column does not have to be listed in the SELECT clause to serve as a basis for sorting
