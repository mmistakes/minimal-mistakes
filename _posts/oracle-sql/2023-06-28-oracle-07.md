📋 This is my note-taking from what I learned in the class "Introduction To Database Concept"
{: .notice--danger}

<br>

# Data Security

- User accounts provide a method of authentication
- They can grant access to specific objects
- They identify owners of objects

<br>

# Creating a User

The CREATE USER command gives each user a user name and password

```
CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

<br>

# Assigning User Privileges

There are two types of privileges:

## System privileges

- Allow access to the database and execution of DDL operations

## Object privileges

- Allow a user to perform DML and query operations

Even with a valid user name and password, a user still needs the CREATE SESSION privilege to connect to a database

```
CREATE USER super IDENTIFIED BY abcd1234 PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```

<br>

# System Privileges

- Affect a user's ability to create, alter, and drop objects
- Use of ANY keyword with an object privilege (INSERT ANY TABLE) is considered a system privilege
- List of all available system privileges available through SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP

## System Privilege Map

![img](../../assets/images/system%20privileges.png)

## Granting System Privileges

System privileges are given through the GRANT command

```
GRANT systemprivilege, ...
TO username|rolename, ...
[WITH ADMIN OPTION];
```

- GRANT clause – identifies system privileges being granted
- TO clause – identifies receiving user or role
- WITH ADMIN OPTION clause – allows a user to grant privilege to other database users

<br>

# Object Privileges

- SELECT – display data from table, view, or sequence
- INSERT – insert data into table or view
- UPDATE – change data in a table or view
- DELETE – remove data from a table or view
- INDEX – create an index for a table
- ALTER – change definition of table or view
- REFERENCES – reference a table when creating a FOREIGN KEY constraint

## Granting Object Privileges

Object privileges are given through the GRANT command

```
GRANT {objectprivilege|ALL} [(columnname), objectprivilege (columnname)]
ON objectname
TO {username|rolename|PUBLIC}
[WITH GRANT OPTION];
```

- GRANT clause – identifies object privileges
- ON clause – identifies object
- TO clause – identifies user or role receiving privilege
- WITH GRANT OPTION clause – gives a user the ability to assign the same privilege to other users

## GRANT Command Examples

Example 1:

Ron Thomas needs the ability to select rows from and insert rows into the CUSTOMERS table, which is in the SCOTT schema.

```
GRANT select, insert ON scott,customers TO rthomas;
```

Example 2:

Ron Thomas needs to be able to select any data from the CUSTOMERS table but be able to modify only the Lastname and Firstname columns.

```
GRANT select, update(lastname, firstname) ON scott.customers TO rthomas;
```

<br>

# Password Management

To change a user password, use the PASSWORD command or the ALTER USER command

```
ALTER USER rthomas IDENTIFIED BY monster42truck;
```

<br>

# Utilizing Roles

A role is a group, or collection, of privileges

![img](../../assets/images/utilizing%20roles.png)

```
CREATE ROLE orderentry;
```

```
GRANT select, insert, update
ON scott.customers
TO orderentry;

GRANT select, insert, update
ON scott.orders
TO orderentry;

GRANT select, insert, update
ON scott.orderitems
TO orderentry;
```

Roles can be assigned to users or other roles:

```
GRANT orderentry
TO rthomas;
```

- A user can be assigned several roles
- All roles can be enabled at one time
- Only one role can be designated as the default role for each user
- Default role can be assigned through the ALTER USER command

```
ALTER ROLE rolename IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

- Roles can be modified with the ALTER ROLE command
- Roles can be assigned passwords

<br>

# Viewing Privilege Information

- ROLE_SYS_PRIVS lists all system privileges assigned to a role
- SESSION_PRIVS lists a user’s currently enabled roles

## ROLE_TAB_PRIVS Example

![img](../../assets/images/role%20tab%20privs.png)

<br>

# Removing Privileges and Roles

Revoke system privileges with the REVOKE command

```
REVOKE systemprivilege, ...
FROM username|rolename;
```

Revoking an object privilege – if the privilege was originally granted using WITH GRANT OPTION, the effect cascades and is revoked from subsequent recipients

```
REVOKE objectprivilege, ...
ON objectname
FROM username|rolename;
```

```
REVOKE rolename
FROM username|rolename;
```

<br>

# Dropping a Role

Users receiving privileges via a role that is dropped will no longer have those privileges available

```
DROP ROLE rolename;
```

```
DROP ROLE orderentry;
```

<br>

# Dropping a User

The DROP USER command is used to remove a user account

```
DROP USER username;
```

<br>

# Summary

- Database account management is only one facet of data security
- A new user account is created with the CREATE USER command
  : - The IDENTIFIED BY clause contains the password for the account
- System privileges are used to grant access to the database and to create, alter, and drop database objects
- The CREATE SESSION system privilege is required before a user can access his account on the Oracle server
- The system privileges available in Oracle 11g can be viewed through the SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP
- Object privileges allow users to manipulate data in database objects
- Privileges are given through the GRANT command
- The ALTER USER command, combined with the PASSWORD EXPIRE clause, can be used to force a user to change her password upon the next attempted login to the database
- The ALTER USER command, combined with the IDENTIFIED BY clause, can be used to change a user’s password
  : - Privileges can be assigned to roles to make the administration of privileges easier
- Roles are collections of privileges
- The ALTER USER command, combined with the DEFAULT ROLE keywords, can be used to assign a default role(s) to a user
- Privileges can be revoked from users and roles using the REVOKE command
- Roles can be revoked from users using the REVOKE command
- A role can be deleted using the DROP ROLE command
- A user account can be deleted using the DROP USER command
