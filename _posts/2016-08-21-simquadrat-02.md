What I wanted to achieve was to let my offical phone at home/at work but still be able to be called on my work numbers (mobile & landline).
This required call forwarding to my private numbers. Easy to achieve even without simquadrat.

Addtionally I want to make calls to partners without disclosing my number. Calling line identity restriction (suppress my number) was no option because I myself do not answer anonymous calls.

The task was to write a program that:

- accepts work related calls on my public cell number
- blocks work related calls on my landline & private cell number
- sets a custom callerid when I call someone from work 
- works on a server behind a firewall and within a vpn


*Comment:
Simquadrat provides a cell number and a landline. Because I ported my cell number to simquadrat I have a total of three numbers which when called end up on my iPhone.
No matter where I am.*
