_Before reading..._

-   _Target Audience:_ This document is geared towards Google Cloud customers
    that export their billing data to Big Query for reporting and analysis.
    They are technically skilled and familiar with writing queries/code to
    retrieve and manipulate data from Big Query.
-   _Scenario:_ The schema for billing data exported to BigQuery was updated
    with additional fields, potentially breaking existing data queries and
    reports for Google Cloud customers. This document explained how to handle
    the schema changes and provided sample queries/code that would help
    future-proof their queries.
-   _Sources:_ I wrote 100% of the content other than the sample queries, which
    were written by the engineer (subject matter expert). The document went
    through the review process, with peer writers and engineers providing
    feedback and suggested edits. The information was derived from regular
    meetings with Technical Program Managers (TPM) and engineers.

_...and here are the samples._

The current version of the document is available at [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery-examples).
Because the content will continue to evolve, I've captured the work I did in the following
PDF file. Additionlly, because "print to PDF" removes much of a web site's styling, I've
included a screenshot image of how the page looked at the time it was published.
