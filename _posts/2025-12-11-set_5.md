### Definition of Relation

The definition of a relation R is that $R ⊂ A \times B$

A is called the domain(정의역) and B is called the codomain(공역).

Also, $(a, b) \in R$ is expressed as $aRb$

+Why is it called a relation?

The notation $xRy$ means that x and y are related according to the rule R.

### Functional(함수적)
The definition of functional is $xRy, xRz\; \Rightarrow y = z$.

This tells us that there is only one codomain for each domain

### Injective(단사적)
The definition of Injective is $xRy, zRy \Rightarrow x = z$.
This tells us that there is only one domain for each codomain.

### Serjective(전사적)
The definition of serjective is $\forall y\in B, \exist x\in A \: s.t.\: xRy$.

This tells us that it is exist x for each y. 

So, it can have several x and only one

### Serial(계열적)

The definition of serial is $\forall x\in A, \exist y\in B \: s.t. \: xRy$.

This tells us that it is exist y for each x.

### etc
When there is an element (a, b) of relation R, (a, b) is called a pair, a is called the first component, and b is called the second component.
