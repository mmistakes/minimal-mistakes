To create a new blog post:

1. Make a copy of this file and save it in the `_posts/blog` directory with a name that follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`
  * For example: `_posts/blog/2017-04-28-Hello-world.md`
2. In your new file update the header information:
  * Update the title by replacing "INSERT TITLE" on line 3 with the title
  * Add an "excerpt". This is a short description that will be seen on the blog landing page or the search page. Try to keep the excerpt one short sentence long.
  * Update the tags by adding them inside the square brackets above and separating with commas
    * Eg: `[onboarding, data science]`
  * Update the date with today's date (or the date you want the post to go live) by replacing the date on line 9.
    * Double check that this is the same date as in the heading.
    * Make sure that the date is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  * Change the author if you aren't `kirstie_whitaker` :wink:
  
3. Write the blog post! You can use markdown to format the text. Check out this handy dandy [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [adam-p](https://github.com/adam-p).
