Congrats to Pieter V and Tom with their new paper that just got accepted in Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience! :boom:
   
The paper presents a computational investigation of the dimensions for adaptive cognitive control. Based on previous models on Neural synchrony (Verguts, 2017) and adaptive control (Botvinick et al., 2001), they investigate on which dimensions (intensity and/or selectivity) and which time scales (fast and/or slow) control needs to be adaptive to connect with empirical data. They found that only the model that was adaptive on both dimensions and both time scales could connect to empirical conflict-adaptation effects in accuracy, response times and midfrontal theta power.
