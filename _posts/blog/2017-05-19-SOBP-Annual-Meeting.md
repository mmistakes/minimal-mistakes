I'm very excited to present our work on [structural brain development during adolescence]() at the Society of [Biological Psychiatry 2017 annual meeting](https://www.sobp.org/
) in San Diego.

My talk is part of a symposium on [Network Architectures of the Healthy Brain as Constraints for the
Spatiotemporal Patterning of Disease](https://sobp.societyconference.com/user/server/submission_pdf.php). We were brought together by chairs [Armin Raznahan](https://twitter.com/bogglerapture) and [Mallar Chakravarty](https://twitter.com/mallarchkrvrty1) and it should be a really fascinating afternoon session.

My slides are linked below, and you can read the paper I'm presenting at [PNAS](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601745113).
