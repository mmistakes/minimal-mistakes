- Define the ==key components== used to create a record-triggered process.
- Describe when to use ==Fast Field Updates==.
- Describe when to use ==Actions== and ==Related Records==.
- Identify ==options== for when to run a flow when a record is updated.
- ==Build a flow== that creates a ==draft contract== based on a change in the opportunity.

2. Plan and Explain your Flow
   **Consider these questions** and use the **Description fields** in your flow.
   - Does the flow run *immediately* or is it *scheduled*?
   - Does the flow *create another record* or *just update a record*?
   - Does the flow run *every time* a record is updated or only the *first time* its criteria are met?
   
2. Configure Start
   Setup -> Flows -> **Start from Scratch** -> Record-Triggered Flow
   
3. Define the Trigger   
   
4. Create a New Record
   on the path after the Start element, click + 
   click **create records**
   
5. Save and Debug
   Best practice to save your flow often and debug immediately after completing it.


### what I learned

*==Record== 
A single row of data -  an individual data instance saved in an Object.
Examples.
- a customer information -> Account record
- a deal or transaction -> Opportunity record
- a contract -> Contract record

==*Record-triggered flow ==
An automated process that executes actions when record is created, updated, or deleted.  It listens for changes and performs specific actions in response.

==Fast Field Updates==
*If you're trying to update the ==**record** that triggered the flow==, then you should optimize the flow using Fast Field Updates. A flow using Fast Field Updates runs ==before the record is saved to the database.==*

-> It ensures that ==any automation logic is reflected== in the saved data
	Easier Way to Think!
	1. You changed the stage of Opportunity to "Proposal/Price Quote"
	2. The system says "Hold on, before saving this, I need to run some automation!"
	   (This is a the Record -Triggered Flow, and more specifically, a **Fast Field Update** flow runs first.)
	   (Because there might be something that needs to be changed before save the Opportunity is saved.)
	3. Now let the flow runs.
	   (For example, it might automatically crate a draft Contract record.)
	4. Once all automation is done, the updated Opportunity is finally saved in the DB.
