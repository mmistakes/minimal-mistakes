# Day 4

# Type annotations

Type annotations let us be explicit about what data types we want, and look like this
```swift
let surname: String = "Park"
var score: Int = 1
var score1: Double = 3.1415
var isAuthenticated: Bool = true
```

we can put type annotaions for Array, dictionary, and set. 
```swift
var albuns: [String] = ["Red", "Fearless"]
var userId: [String: String] = ["id": "@gmail.com"]
var userPassword: [String: Int] = ["id": 0000]
var books: Set<String> = Set(["Foundation", "Girl", "Eye"])
```

<br/>

# Create an Empty Array of Strings
Type annotation isn't required, but we still need to know that an array of strings is written as [String] so that we can make the thing. 
```swift
var teams: [String] = [String]()
```

Assign an empty array to it
```swift
var cities: [String] = []
var clues = [String]()
```

## we can create a constant that doesn't have a value just yet, later on provide that value, and Swift will ensure we don't accidentally use it until a value is present. it will also ensure that we only ever set the value once, so that it remains constant. we are saying 'username' will contain a string at some point, and we provide a value before using it. 
```swift
let username: String
username = "id"
print(username)
```
<br/>

# Checkpoint 2
Create an array of strings, then write some code that prints the number of items in the array and also the number of unique items in the array. 
```swift
var check = ["voucher", "age", "Cotton", "feedback", "inject", "inject"]
print(check.count)
print(check)

var check1 = (check)
print(check1.count)
```
