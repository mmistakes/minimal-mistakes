**Definition:**
*We challenged ourselves to create a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. This is material design. This spec is a living document that will be updated as we continue to develop the tenets and specifics of material design.*

**Goals:**
*Create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.*
*Develop a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. Mobile precepts are fundamental, but touch, voice, mouse, and keyboard are all ﬁrst-class input methods.*

## Resources

So Material Design is nothing more than a visual specification built by [Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).

But you can use or implement it on every kind of visual applications such as...

* Websites
* Blogs
* Documentations


... and with every kind of frontend technologies, frameworks or libs:

* AngularJs
* EmberJs
* Polymer
* Wordpress
* Jekyll
* Custom


So I decided to create, update and maintain a list of Material Design Resource to help everyone to access easily and quickly to Material Design:

* [Material Design Resources](http://ypereirareis.github.io/material-design-resources/)
* [Github project](https://github.com/ypereirareis/material-design-resources)
