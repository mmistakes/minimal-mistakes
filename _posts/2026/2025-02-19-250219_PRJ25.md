#  A Motivating Expedition As a Data Scientiest/ Analyst 
This space is dedicated to reviewing and reinforcing key concepts from the Urban Computing & AI class. As an aspiring Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer, I aim to deepen my understanding of the topics covered in the course while applying them to real-world problems.

Through this review project, I plan to:
✅ Strengthen my knowledge of urban computing, machine learning, and AI applications
✅ Revisit essential theories, algorithms, and methodologies to solidify my foundation
✅ Develop practical skills by implementing concepts through hands-on projects
✅ Connect insights from the course to my broader career goals in AI-driven urban analytics

This initiative is more than just a review—it’s a structured ***learning journey to bridge academic concepts with practical problem-solving, ensuring a stronger grasp of AI and ML*** . 🚀
