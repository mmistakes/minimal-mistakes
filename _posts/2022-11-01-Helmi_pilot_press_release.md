<!-- # Finland opens quantum computer for research purposes – the fusion of quantum computing and supercomputing enables completely new science -->

*VTT’s quantum computer HELMI (“Pearl”) has been connected with the pan-European supercomputer LUMI (“Snow”), 
hosted by CSC - IT Center for Science. The connection to Europe’s most powerful classical supercomputer 
enables the best possible use of the quantum computer’s computing power. This is the first time in Europe 
that this kind of hybrid service connecting a supercomputer and a general-purpose quantum computer is 
opened for researchers.*

Quantum computers, while potentially extremely powerful at certain tasks, need supervision by traditional 
classical computers. Finland is one of the few countries worldwide that has connected a quantum computer 
and a supercomputer. Finland's first quantum computer, the 5-qubit HELMI hosted by VTT Technical Research 
Centre of Finland became operational in 2021. The LUMI supercomputer, hosted by CSC in Europe’s greenest 
HPC facility, also started its operations in 2021. 

The successful connection of HELMI and LUMI paves the way to a future where quantum computers and 
traditional high-performance computers work together, solving those most difficult of problems that 
neither can solve alone. Integrating HELMI with LUMI enables hybrid computing projects and boosts the 
development of the required quantum algorithms and software. From here, an understanding about the 
potential of this technology for solving real-world use-cases will arise. 

“VTT wants to do applied research using the quantum computer and learn more about these possibilities. 
We see great potential in quantum computing for accelerating innovation for the benefit of companies and 
the whole society. We will continue to build bigger and more powerful quantum computers, which will also 
become available for users through the same gateway”, says **Pekka Pursula**, Research Manager at VTT. 

“LUMI is now the most powerful quantum-enabled supercomputing infrastructure in the world, 
in addition to being a leading platform for artificial intelligence. This means that we have all the 
drivers of the future of computing seamlessly integrated and ready to be utilized”, notes **Pekka Manninen**, 
Director of LUMI.

While supercomputers are immensely powerful by themselves, some types of problems can only be solved 
faster, more accurately, or using less energy when partially solved on quantum computers. These problems 
include developing new products and materials for example in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and battery 
industries. Quantum machine learning will take artificial intelligence to new heights. Thanks to the combined 
computing power, machine learning applications for generating novel molecular structures based on existing 
molecular data could be faster and more accurate, speeding up significantly the process of new material 
design. Optimisation of supply chains, travel routes, and portfolio management are also high on the list of 
future applications exhibiting so-called quantum advantage, where quantum-accelerated high-performance 
computing surpasses the capacity of classical supercomputers alone. 

Some of the first concrete advantages can be expected in areas where high accuracy and quality of 
computational predictions are crucial, but the time for finding the answer is limited. One potential 
future application is short-term weather prediction, where it is important to quickly and accurately predict 
for example thunderstorms, hurricane paths and tsunami propagation. This is connected to real-time analysis 
of earth observation data from satellites. In the long term, high-quality image processing could, for example, 
detect a budding forest fire before it spreads uncontrollably. In the financial sector, higher accuracy in 
algorithmic trading naturally comes with instant reward.

## Quantum algorithms at researchers’ fingertips

The connection was built in cooperation between VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, CSC, 
and Aalto University, within the framework of the Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure FiQCI.  
Now, through an open Call, pilot access to the infrastructure will be granted for users from Finnish 
universities and research organisations. This allows researchers to try out and experiment with 
quantum computing for various uses. 

“Quantum computers are in many respects strange and unfamiliar, and it will be exciting to see how our 
customers end up using them. New technology tends to find uses in areas no-one even thought of before!”, 
comments **Mikael Johansson**, Quantum Strategist at CSC. 

Real quantum computers behave rather unpredictably, it is in fact in their very nature. That is why 
completely new algorithms and approaches to problem solving need to be developed. First-hand availability 
of quantum computing gives users the opportunity to experience and adapt to the new computing paradigm. 
This is crucially important in order to prepare for the upcoming quantum revolution in scientific computing. 
"We are creating the basis for future large-scale quantum computing infrastructure in Finland with this 
initiative. The first generation of quantum computers will be most valuable for training researchers and 
students in quantum algorithms and computing, and related technologies", says **Tapio Ala-Nissilä**, 
Professor of physics at Aalto.

After the academic pilot the aim is to open the connection for a wider audience. The newly established 
connection gives valuable insight on the possibilities of quantum computing, as well as practical know-how 
on how to utilise the new technology efficiently.

The Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure, supported by the Academy of Finland and NextGenerationEU is 
a central part of the vibrant quantum technology ecosystem in Finland. FiQCI aims at providing true 
quantum acceleration of research and development. The connection between HELMI and LUMI is the first 
major milestone on this road. A 20-qubit quantum computer is currently under development at VTT, with a 
50-qubit upgrade planned for 2024. Beyond this point, the complexity of quantum computers surpasses the 
modelling capacity of even the largest supercomputers, marking the start of a new era of science. 
VTT, CSC, and Aalto University are also seeking global strategic partnerships to promptly usher in the quantum age.
