## 1. Introduction

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, it's a client-server communication protocol where one program can request a service on a different address that may be on the same or different system connected by a network. It enables users to work with remote procedures as if they were local.

In this article we will cover `gRPC` which is a modern Open Source RPC framework designed by Google that uses `Protocol Buffers` for data serialization and `HTTP/2` as a transport layer. `gRPC` is language independent therefore it's possible for a client written in one language to communication with a server written in another.

At the time of writing this article, `gRPC` officially supports 11 programming languages which include Python, Java, Kotlin, and C++ to mention but a few. Scala is not officially supported at the moment however the `ScalaPB` library provides a good wrapper around the official `gRPC Java` implementation, it provides an easy API that enables translation of `Protocol Buffers` to Scala case classes with support for Scala3, Scala.js, and Java Interoperability.

One of the main use cases for `gRPC` is communication between internal microservices. In the following sections, we'll create a `gRPC` server and client that will process streams of orders sent from an online store.
We'll also learn how to write a `.proto` file which we'll use to generate necessary case classes and `traits` using the `Fs2Grpc` library and finally dig into `Scalapb` to generate custom types for our application.

## 2. Setting Up

In our new Scala project, let's create a `plugins.sbt` file in the `project` folder with the following code:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.typelevel" % "sbt-fs2-grpc" % "2.7.4")
```

Also add the following code to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
val scala3Version = "3.3.0"
val http4sVersion = "0.23.23"
val weaverVersion = "0.8.3"

lazy val protobuf =
  project
    .in(file("protobuf"))
    .settings(
      name := "protobuf",
      scalaVersion := scala3Version
    )
    .enablePlugins(Fs2Grpc)

lazy val root =
  project
    .in(file("."))
    .settings(
      name := "root",
      scalaVersion := scala3Version,
      libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        "io.grpc" % "grpc-netty-shaded" % scalapb.compiler.Version.grpcJavaVersion,
        "org.http4s" %% "http4s-ember-server" % http4sVersion,
        "org.http4s" %% "http4s-dsl" % http4sVersion,
        "org.http4s" %% "http4s-circe" % http4sVersion,
        "com.disneystreaming" %% "weaver-cats" % weaverVersion % Test
      ),
      testFrameworks += new TestFramework("weaver.framework.CatsEffect")
    )
    .dependsOn(protobuf)
```

Here we have a `root` project which depends on `protobuf`, with this design, when `root` is compiled, the `Fs2Grpc` plugin will automatically generate case classes from our `.proto` file.

We'll also use `circe` for `JSON` encoding and decoding, and `http4s` to develop our `REST` server from which we'll forward orders to the `gRPC` order service.

## 3. The .proto file

Create a folder called `protobuf` in the root of your project and add an `orders.proto` file in the following path, `protobuf/src/main/protobuf/orders.proto`.

Now add the following code to the file.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package com.rockthejvm.protos;
```

A `.proto` file contains Google's `protocol buffer` language which is used to structure protocol buffer data. `Scalapb` supports both proto2 and proto3 versions.

In the first line of the file, we define `syntax` as `proto3` which is the protobuf language version, next we specify `package` as `com.rockthejvm.protos`, this will be the namespace through which we access the case classes generated by `Fs2Grpc`.

Let's define some data structures that will be used in our application.

```proto
...
message Item{
  string name = 1;
  int32 qty = 2;
  double amount = 3;
}
```

A `message` is a data structure containing a set of typed fields. `Item` contains data for each product in an order, it has three fields `name`, `qty`, and `amount` of type `string`, `int32`, and `double` respectfully. The "= 1", "= 2" and "= 3" are unique tags used by each field in binary encoding. `message` gets translated to a case class during compilation.

```proto
...
message OrderRequest {
  int32 orderid = 1;
  repeated Item items = 2;
}

message OrderReply {
  int32 orderid = 1;
  repeated Item items = 2;
  double total = 3;
}
```

Above we define two more `message` types, `OrderRequest`, and `OrderReply`. `OrderRequest` consists of `orderid` of type `int32` and `items` of type `Item`, this shows that we can nest a `message` within a `message`. The `repeated` annotation means that `items` can be repeated any number of times, in Scala this becomes a `Seq` of `Item`.
`OrderReply` also consists of an `orderid` of type `int32`, `items`, a `repeated` `Item`, and `total` of type `double`.

```proto
...
service Order {
  rpc SendOrderStream (stream OrderRequest) returns (stream OrderReply) {}
}
```

Lastly, we define our `Order` service which contains a single function, `SendOrderStream()` that takes a stream of `OrderRequest` and returns a stream of `OrderReply`. The `Order` service will be translated to a Scala `trait` through which we can access our function.

Here's the full code:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package com.rockthejvm.protos;

message Item{
  string name =1;
  int32 qty = 2;
  double amount = 3 [(scalapb.field).type = "squants.market.Money"];
}

message OrderRequest {
  int32 orderid = 1;
  repeated Item items = 2;
}

message OrderReply {
  int32 orderid = 1;
  repeated Item items = 2;
  double total = 3 [(scalapb.field).type = "squants.market.Money"];
}

service Order {
  rpc SendOrderStream (stream OrderRequest) returns (stream OrderReply) {}
}
```
Now we can head over to our terminal, navigate to our project directory and run `sbt compile`, `Fs2Grpc` should generate the necessary Scala files according to what we defined in `orders.proto`.

After compilation, we'll find two sets of generated files in `protobuf/target/scala-3.3.0/src_managed/main`, one under a `Fs2Grpc` folder that contains our `trait` while the rest are cases classes will be under a `Scalapb` folder. If we look at the top of each of these files, we'll find that they are all under the `com.rockthejvm.protos.orders` package namespace that we defined in our `orders.proto` file.

## 4. The gRPC server
Let's take a look at the `OrderFs2Grpc.scala` file generated by `Fs2Grpc`:

```scala
trait OrderFs2Grpc[F[_], A] {
  def sendOrderStream(request: _root_.fs2.Stream[F, com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.OrderRequest], ctx: A): _root_.fs2.Stream[F, com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.OrderReply]
}
```
We'll notice that an `OrderFs2Grpc` `trait` was created with a single function `sendOrderStream()` similar to what we defined in `orders.proto`, however, this function has no implementation, this is what we'll need to provide in the next step.

Create `OrderService.scala` in the following path `src/main/scala/OrderService.scala` and add the following code:

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.service

import com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.*
import cats.effect.*
import io.grpc.*
import fs2.Stream

class OrderService extends OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata] {
  override def sendOrderStream(
      request: Stream[IO, OrderRequest],
      ctx: Metadata
  ): Stream[IO, OrderReply] = {
    request.map { orderReq =>
      OrderReply(
        orderReq.orderid,
        orderReq.items,
        orderReq.items.map(i => i.amount).reduce(_ + _)
      )
    }
  }
}
```
Here we create a new class `OrderService` that extends our `OrderFs2Grpc` trait, it requires type parameters, an effect type, and a context which we provide as `IO` from `cats.effect` and `Metadata` from `io.grpc`. `Metadata` provides access to read and write metadata values to be exchanged during a call.

In our implementation of `sendOrderStream` above, we map on `request` which is an `fs2` stream of type `Stream[IO, OrderRequest]` and for each `OrderRequest`, we produce an `OrderReply` with the same `orderid`, `items` and the `total` amount spent calculated using the `reduce(_+_)` function.

```scala
import io.grpc.netty.shaded.io.grpc.netty.NettyServerBuilder
import fs2.grpc.syntax.all.*

// ...

object Server {
  private val orderService: Resource[IO, ServerServiceDefinition] =
    OrderFs2Grpc.bindServiceResource[IO](new OrderService)

  private def runServer(
      service: ServerServiceDefinition
  ): Resource[IO, Server] =
    NettyServerBuilder
      .forPort(9999)
      .addService(service)
      .resource[IO]

  val grpcServer: Resource[IO, Server] =
    orderService
      .flatMap(x => runServer(x))
}
```
Above we create our `gRPC` service by calling the `bindServiceResource()` method on `OrderFs2Grpc` and passing it a service implementation, in our case a new instance of `OrderService`, this returns a `Resource[IO, ServerServiceDefinition]`.

The `runServer` function uses `NettyServerBuilder` to create our server which will run on port `9999`. In the last line, we create our final `Resource` by calling `flatMap` on the `orderService` `Resource` and passing the `ServerServiceDefinition` to `runServer()`.

Here's the full code:
```scala
package com.rockthejvm.service

import com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.*
import cats.effect.*
import io.grpc.*
import fs2.Stream
import io.grpc.netty.shaded.io.grpc.netty.NettyServerBuilder
import fs2.grpc.syntax.all.*

class OrderService extends OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata] {
  override def sendOrderStream(
      request: Stream[IO, OrderRequest],
      ctx: Metadata
  ): Stream[IO, OrderReply] = {
    request.map { orderReq =>
      OrderReply(
        orderReq.orderid,
        orderReq.items.map(i => i.name),
        orderReq.items.map(i => i.amount).reduce(_ + _)
      )
    }
  }
}

object Server {
  private val orderService: Resource[IO, ServerServiceDefinition] =
    OrderFs2Grpc.bindServiceResource[IO](new OrderService)

  private def runServer(
      service: ServerServiceDefinition
  ): Resource[IO, Server] =
    NettyServerBuilder
      .forPort(9999)
      .addService(service)
      .resource[IO]

  val grpcServer: Resource[IO, Server] =
    orderService
      .flatMap(x => runServer(x))
}
```
## 4. The gRPC client
Create `OrderClient.scala` in the following path, `src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/client/OrderClient.scala` and add the following code.

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.client

import cats.effect.*
import io.grpc.netty.shaded.io.grpc.netty.NettyChannelBuilder
import io.grpc.*
import fs2.grpc.syntax.all.*

object Client {
  private val resource: Resource[IO, OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata]] =
    NettyChannelBuilder
      .forAddress("127.0.0.1", 9999)
      .usePlaintext()
      .resource[IO]
      .flatMap(ch => OrderFs2Grpc.stubResource[IO](ch))
}
```
Here we create a `Client` object with its first element, `resource`. We use `NettyChannelBuilder` to construct a channel that uses Netty transport. A channel provides a connection to a network socket or component that is capable of I/O operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
The `forAddress()` method adds host and port values (same as our server) while the `usePlaintext()` method sets the negotiation type for the Http/2 connection to `PLAINTEXT` instead of `TLS` which is the default for a `ManagedChannel`, and the `resource()` extension method from FS2 builds the `ManagedChannel` into a `Resource`. We then create a `stubResource` out of that channel, finally returning an instance of `OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata]`.

The gRPC client will enable us to directly call methods on this instance, therefore we'll be able to process multiple orders from an `fs2` stream by invoking the `sendOrderStream()` function, ignoring that the actual implementation of that method involves a remote connection to a different service, completing the RPC protocol.

Here's how we can implement this:

```scala
// ...
import com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.*
import fs2.Stream

object Client {
  // ...
  private def formatItemsToStr(items: Seq[Item]): Seq[String] = {
    items.map(x => s"[${x.qty} of ${x.name}]")
  }

  private def processOrders(
      orderStub: OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata],
      orders: Stream[IO, OrderRequest]
  ): IO[List[String]] = {
    for {
      response <- orderStub.sendOrderStream(
        orders,
        new Metadata()
      )
      str <- Stream.eval(
        IO(
          s"Processed orderid: ${response.orderid} for items: ${formatItemsToStr(response.items)
              .mkString(" and ")}, totaling to ${response.total.toString}"
        )
      )
    } yield str
  }.compile.toList
}
```
We define `processOrders()`, a function that takes a `service` of type `OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata]` and `orders` of type `Stream[IO, OrderRequest]` as arguments. When we call `sendOrderStream(orders, new Metadata())` on `orderStub`, we get a `Stream[IO, OrderReply]`, which we `flatMap` to format each `OrderReply` into a `String` that informs the user of their `orderid`, the `items` they bought and the `total` amount they spent for each order, this `Stream` is compiled to return an `IO[List[String]]`.

We use the `formatItemsToStr()` function to format the `Seq[Item]` as part of the returned `String`.

Here's the full code:

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.client

import cats.effect.*
import io.grpc.netty.shaded.io.grpc.netty.NettyChannelBuilder
import io.grpc.*
import fs2.grpc.syntax.all.*
import com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.*
import fs2.Stream

object Client {
  private val resource: Resource[IO, OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata]] =
    NettyChannelBuilder
      .forAddress("127.0.0.1", 9999)
      .usePlaintext()
      .resource[IO]
      .flatMap(ch => OrderFs2Grpc.stubResource[IO](ch))

  private def formatItemsToStr(items: Seq[Item]): Seq[String] = {
    items.map(x => s"[${x.qty} of ${x.name}]")
  }

  private def processOrders(
      service: OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata],
      orders: Stream[IO, OrderRequest]
  ): IO[List[String]] = {
    for {
      response <- service.sendOrderStream(
        orders,
        new Metadata()
      )
      str <- Stream.eval(
        IO(
          s"Processed orderid: ${response.orderid} for items: ${formatItemsToStr(response.items)
              .mkString(" and ")}, totaling to ${response.total.toString}"
        )
      )
    } yield str
  }.compile.toList
}
```

## 5. The Routes
In this section, we define the logic to handle incoming requests to our `REST` server. Create `AppRoutes.scala` in the following path `src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/routes/AppRoutes.scala`, and add the code below:

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.routes

import cats.effect.IO
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*

object AppRoutes {
  def restService = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
    case req @ GET -> Root / "index.html" =>
      StaticFile
        .fromString[IO](
          "src/main/resources/index.html",
          Some(req)
        )
        .getOrElseF(NotFound())
  }
}
```
Above we define our first route `/index.html` which serves the client with an `HTML` page where one can make orders from our online store. It uses the `fromString()` method from `Http4s`'s `StaticFile` object which takes a `URL` `String`  to an `HTML` file and an `Option` of a `Request[IO]`. If the `URL` is incorrect the client receives status code `404`, meaning the page is not available.

```scala
// ...
import com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.OrderRequest

object AppRoutes {
  case class Orders(values: Seq[OrderRequest])

  def restService = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
    // ...
    case req @ POST -> Root / "submit" => ???
  }
}
```
Next, we create our second route, `/submit` which will receive `POST` requests with a user's orders. We create an `Orders` case class to capture the `Seq` of `OrderRequest`s that the user sends. However, to parse our request, we'll need an `EntityDecoder` for `Orders` in scope. We'll also need `Decoder`s for `Orders`, `OrderRequest`, and `Item` in scope.

```scala
import com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.{OrderRequest, Item}
import org.http4s.circe.*
import io.circe.Decoder
import io.circe.syntax.*
import scala.util.Random

object AppRoutes {
  case class Orders(values: Seq[OrderRequest])

  object Orders {
    private given itemDecoder: Decoder[Item] = Decoder.instance { h =>
      for {
        name <- h.get[String]("name")
        qty <- h.get[Int]("quantity")
        amount <- h.get[Double]("amount")
      } yield Item.of(
        name,
        qty,
        amount
      )
    }

    private given orDecoder: Decoder[OrderRequest] = Decoder.instance { h =>
        h.get[Seq[Item]]("items").map { items =>
          OrderRequest.of(Random.between(1000, 2000), items)
      }
    }

    given ordersDecoder: Decoder[Orders] = Decoder.instance { h =>
      h.get[Seq[OrderRequest]]("orders").map { orders =>
        Orders(orders)
      }
    }

    given ordersEntityDecoder: EntityDecoder[IO, Orders] = jsonOf[IO, Orders]
  }
  //...
}
```

Here we create a companion object for `Orders`, the last line is an `EntityDecoder` for `Orders` which uses the `jsonOf[IO, Orders]` function provided by `http4s.circe`. For this `EntityDecoder` to work, we needed to provide a `given` of type `Decoder[Orders]`, `ordersDecoder`, which is implemented with the help of `circe`'s `Decoder.instance` function. We target the `orders` key from the incoming `JSON` string and pass its value to the `Orders` case class.

The `ordersDecorder` also requires the presence of `given` `Decoder`s for `Item` and `OrderRequest` in scope, which were also added to the `Orders` companion object. When creating the `OrderRequest` `Decoder`, we use a `Random` `Int` between 1000 and 2000 to simulate the `orderid`.

`Scalapb` provides a convenient `of()` function to pass data to our case class without having to deal with `UnknownFieldSet.empty` which if you check on the generated code is part of every case class.

We can also pass values to these case classes in different ways depending on your preference, here are some examples with `OrderRequest`:

```scala
// Using the of() method
OrderRequest.of(Random.between(1000, 2000), items)

//Using withX() method
OrderRequest()
  .withOrderid(Random.between(1000,2000))
  .withItems(items)

//Default method
// Here we would have to import UnknownFieldSet
import scalapb.UnknownFieldSet
OrderRequest(
  Random.between(1000,2000),
  items,
  _root_.scalapb.UnknownFieldSet.empty
)
```

Let's see how to process the incoming `POST` requests.

```scala
// ...
import com.rockthejvm.client.Client
import fs2.Stream

object AppRoutes {
  // ...
  def restService(service: OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata]) = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
    // ...
     case req @ POST -> Root / "submit" =>
      req
        .as[Orders]
        .flatMap { x =>
          Client.processOrders(service, Stream.emits(x.values).covary[IO])
        }
        .handleError(x => List(x.getMessage))
        .flatMap(x => Ok(x.asJson))
  }
}
```
Using the `as()` method on the request parses our JSON string returning `IO[Orders]`. We then `flatMap` on this to pass `Orders` to our `processOrders()` function which communicates with the `gRPC` server to process them. This returns either an `IO[List[String]]` in case of success or an error message which we package as a `List` in case of failure. This `List` is then passed back to the browser as a `JSON` array of strings.

Here's the full code:

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.routes

import cats.effect.IO
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*
import com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.{OrderRequest, Item}
import org.http4s.circe.*
import io.circe.Decoder
import io.circe.syntax.*
import scala.util.Random
import com.rockthejvm.client.Client
import fs2.Stream

object AppRoutes {
  case class Orders(values: Seq[OrderRequest])
  object Orders {
    private given itemDecoder: Decoder[Item] = Decoder.instance { h =>
      for {
        name <- h.get[String]("name")
        qty <- h.get[Int]("quantity")
        amount <- h.get[Double]("amount")
      } yield Item.of(
        name,
        qty,
        amount
      )
    }

    private given orDecoder: Decoder[OrderRequest] = Decoder.instance { h =>
        h.get[Seq[Item]]("items").map { items =>
          OrderRequest.of(Random.between(1000, 2000), items)
      }
    }

    given ordersDecoder: Decoder[Orders] = Decoder.instance { h =>
      h.get[Seq[OrderRequest]]("orders").map { orders =>
        Orders(orders)
      }
    }

    given ordersEntityDecoder: EntityDecoder[IO, Orders] = jsonOf[IO, Orders]
  }

  def restService(service: OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata]) = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
    case req @ GET -> Root / "index.html" =>
      StaticFile
        .fromString[IO](
          "src/main/resources/index.html",
          Some(req)
        )
        .getOrElseF(NotFound())
    case req @ POST -> Root / "submit" =>
      req
        .as[Orders]
        .flatMap { x =>
          Client.processOrders(service, Stream.emits(x.values).covary[IO])
        }
        .handleError(x => List(x.getMessage))
        .flatMap(x => Ok(x.asJson))
  }
}
```

## 6. The "web UI"
Create the `index.html` file in the following path, `src/main/resources/index.html`, this file is quite lengthy, we can copy the contents from this [link](https://github.com/hkateu/orderbuffer/blob/main/src/main/resources/index.html).
It consists of 3 forms each with the following format:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: darkorchid">Samsung</span><br />
    <span style="color: crimson">FlagShip Phones</span><br />
    <input type="radio" id="phone1" name="flagship" value="s23"/>
    <label for="phone1">Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra -> $999.99</label><br />
    <input type="radio" id="phone2" name="flagship" value="fold5" checked/>
    <label for="phone2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 -> $1800.00</label><br />
    <input type="radio" id="phone3" name="flagship" value="note"/>
    <label for="phone3">Samsung Galaxy Note 23 -> $1000.00</label><br />
    <span style="color: crimson">Quantity</span><br />
    <input type="number" name="flagshipQty" min=1 max=4 value="1"/><br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: crimson">Budget Phones</span><br />
    <input type="radio" id="phone4" name="budget" value="a23" checked/>
    <label for="gs1">Samsung Galaxy A23 5G -> $299.99</label><br />
    <input type="radio" id="phone5" name="budget" value="a54" />
    <label for="gs2">Samsung Galaxy A54 -> $449.99</label><br />
    <input type="radio" id="phone6" name="budget" value="a42" />
    <label for="gs3">Samsung A42 5G -> $399.99</label><br />
    <span style="color: crimson">Quantity</span><br />
    <input type="number" name="budgetQty" min=1 max=4 value="1"/><br />
    <br />
  </fieldset>
</form>
```
Each form has two sections where one can select a Flagship phone and a Budget phone with one's preferred quantity, some default values have been set but can be changed to your preference.

```html
<div>
  <button id="submitBtn">Submit All</button>
</div>
<div id="reply"></div>
```
We provide a `Submit All` button that will fetch all the inputted data using JavaScript, post the data, and append the response to the `div` with the id `reply`.

```js
const prices = {
  iphone: 1099.99,
  s23: 999.99,
  edge: 799.99,
  nord: 270.0,
  a14: 200.0,
  motog: 170.0,
};
const names = {
  iphone: "Iphone 14",
  s23: "Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra",
  edge: "Motorola Moto Edge+",
  nord: "OnePlus Nord N30",
  a14: "Samsung Galaxy A14",
  motog: "Motorola Moto G Stylus",
};

const forms = document.getElementsByTagName("form");

const submitButton = document.getElementById("submitBtn");
const replyDiv = document.getElementById("reply");
```
To process the forms we first create two objects containing the phone prices and phone names. We also get all the form elements and assign them to `forms` using the `document.getElementsByTagName("form")` function. Next, we get the submit button and div to post our response and assign them to `submitButton` and `replyDiv` respectively using the `document.getElementById()` function.

```js
...
submitButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  var orderObj = { orders: [] };
  for (let i = 0; i < forms.length; i++) {
    const formData = new FormData(forms[i]);
    const jsonObject = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    var jsonFormatted = {
      items: [
        {
          name: names[jsonObject["flagship"]],
          quantity: jsonObject["flagshipQty"],
          amount: prices[jsonObject["flagship"]],
        },
        {
          name: names[jsonObject["budget"]],
          quantity: jsonObject["budgetQty"],
          amount: prices[jsonObject["budget"]],
        },
      ],
    };
    orderObj.orders.push(jsonFormatted);
  }
}
```
Here, we create an event listener for a `click` event on the submit Button. When the button is clicked we run through all the forms using a `for loop` and fetch the data from each by calling `new FormData(forms[i])`.
We then reformat the data to resemble our Scala case classes and assign each form's data to `jsonFormatted`, this is then pushed to `orderObj` which is now an `object` containing an `Array` of `orders`.

```js
submitButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  ...
  async function sendForm() {
    const res = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/submit", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(orderObj),
    });
    const resData = await res.json();
    return resData;
  }
  return sendForm()
    .then((arr) => arr.map((str) => {
      var p = document.createElement('p')
      p.textContent = str;
      p.style.color = "darkorchid";
      replyDiv.appendChild(p);
    }))
    .catch((err) => (replyDiv.innerHTML = err));
}
```
The last section is an `async` function `sendForm()` that uses JavaScripts `fetch API` to submit our from data as `JSON` and append the response to the a `div`.

Heres the full javaScript code:

```js
      const prices = {
        s23: 999.99,
        fold5: 1800.00,
        note: 1000.00,

        lfour: 270.00,
        teniv: 200.00,
        tenv: 409.00,
      };
      const names = {
        s23: "Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra",
        fold5: "Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5",
        note: "Samsung Galaxy Note 23",
        a23: "Samsung Galaxy A23 5G ",
        a54: "Samsung Galaxy A54",
        a42: "Samsung A42 5G",
        edgeNew: "Motorola Moto Edge+",
        razr: "Motorola Moto Razr+",
        think: "Motorola ThinkPhone",
        edgeOld: "Motorola Moto Edge",
        stylus: "Moto G Stylus 5G",
        motog: "Moto G Power",
        fiveiv: "Sony Xperia 5 IV",
        onev: "Sony Xperia 1 V",
        pro: "Sony Xperia Pro-1",
        lfour: "Sony Xperia L4",
        teniv: "Sony Xperia 10 IV",
        tenv: "Sony Xperia 10 V",
      };

const forms = document.getElementsByTagName("form");

const myButton = document.getElementById("submitBtn");
const replyDiv = document.getElementById("reply");

myButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  var orderObj = { orders: [] };
  for (let i = 0; i < forms.length; i++) {
    const formData = new FormData(forms[i]);
    const jsonObject = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    var jsonFormatted = {
      items: [
        {
          name: names[jsonObject["flagship"]],
          quantity: jsonObject["flagshipQty"],
          amount: prices[jsonObject["flagship"]],
        },
        {
          name: names[jsonObject["budget"]],
          quantity: jsonObject["budgetQty"],
          amount: prices[jsonObject["budget"]],
        },
      ],
    };
    orderObj.orders.push(jsonFormatted);
  }

  async function sendForm() {
    const res = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/submit", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(orderObj),
    });
    const resData = await res.json();
    return resData;
  }
  return sendForm()
    .then((arr) => arr.map((str) => {
      var p = document.createElement('p')
      p.textContent = str;
      p.style.color = "darkorchid";
      replyDiv.appendChild(p);
    }))
    .catch((err) => (replyDiv.innerHTML = err));
});
```
## 7. The main program
In this section, we bring everything together to run our program. First, we'll need a server to run `restService` that we created previously. Create `Main.scala` in the following path, `src/main/scala/Main.scala`, and add the following code.

```scala
import cats.effect.*
import org.http4s.ember.server.EmberServerBuilder
import com.comcast.ip4s.*

object Main extends IOApp {
  def httpServerResource(remoteService: OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata]) =
    EmberServerBuilder
      .default[IO]
      .withHost(host"0.0.0.0")
      .withPort(port"8080")
      .withHttpApp(AppRoutes.restService(remoteService).orNotFound)
      .build
}
```
We use `EmberServerBuilder` to create our server with port number 8080 and build it with our `restService`.

```scala
import com.rockthejvm.service.Server.grpcServer
import cats.syntax.parallel.*

object Main extends IOApp {
  // ...
  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = for {
    remoteService <- grpcServer
        .evalMap(svr => IO(svr.start()))
        .useForever
        .fork
    httpServer <- httpServerResource(remoteService).useForever.fork
    _ <- IO.never
  } yield ()
}
```
In the `run()` function we call both `httpServer` and `grpcServer` in parellel. We also call `evalMap()` on the `grpcServer` `Resource` to start the server and make sure it keeps running by calling `useForever()`.

Now Let's test our application.
When we run our server and navigate to `localhost:8080/index.html`, we should be greeted with the following page.

![index.html](../images/grpc/xonalMobile.png)

Once the form is filled and submitted, we should see a response similar to the following.

![server response](../images/grpc/results.png)

## 8. Managing Currency with Squants
Throughout the article we've been representing money as `Double`, we could improve our code by using the `Squants` library to manage currency values, specifically `Squants`' `Money` type.

Therefore the question arises, if the case classes are generated by `Scalapb`, how can we make it so that `Scalapb` generates `Squants`' `Money` type for `amount` and `total`? `Scalapb` provides a mechanism for customizing generated types convenient for such scenarios.

We'll need to add the following two libraries to our `protobuf` project inside `build.sbt`.

```diff
...
lazy val protobuf =
  project
    .in(file("protobuf"))
    .settings(
      name := "protobuf",
      scalaVersion := scala3Version,
+     libraryDependencies += "com.thesamet.scalapb" %% "scalapb-runtime" % scalapb.compiler.Version.scalapbVersion % "protobuf",
+     libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "squants" % squantsVersion
    )
    .enablePlugins(Fs2Grpc)
...
```
Once we compile our project, we'll notice a new file, `scalapb.proto` in the following path `protobuf/target/protobuf_external/scalapb/scalapb.proto` which contains the necessary methods to make our type conversion.
Still in `orders.proto`, let's import this new proto file into scope.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package com.rockthejvm.protos;

import "scalapb/scalapb.proto";
```
Note: If you are using IntelliJ, this import might show `red` because the proto plugin hasn't scanned the `protobuf_external` path, therefore, you'll need to add it there. IntelliJ will show this as a suggestion.

Now we can make changes to the `amount` and `total` for `Item` and `OrderReply`.

```diff
...
message Item{
  string name =1;
  int32 qty = 2;
- double amount = 3;
+ double amount = 3 [(scalapb.field).type = "squants.market.Money"];
}
...
message OrderReply {
  int32 orderid = 1;
  repeated Item items = 2;
- double total = 3;
+ double total = 3 [(scalapb.field).type = "squants.market.Money"];
}
```
Above, we set `(scalapb.field).type` to `squants.market.Money` which is the custom type we need for `amount` and `total`.

A few more extra steps are still required, let's create a `Customtype.scala` file in the following path `protobuf/src/main/protobuf/Customtype.scala` and add the following code.

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.protos

import squants.market.{USD, Money}
import scalapb.TypeMapper

given typeMapper: TypeMapper[Double, Money] =
  TypeMapper[Double, Money](s => USD(s))(_.amount.toDouble)
```
`Scalapb` provides a `TypeMapper` object whose `apply` method takes two arguments, a function from the base type to a custom type i.e. `Double` to `Money`, and a function from the custom type back to the base type i.e. `Money` to `Double`. We provide `typeMapper` as a `given` so that when in scope, the generated `Scalapb` case classes will contain the expected `Money` type instead of `Double`.

To bring this `given` into scope when the case classes are generated, we'll need to add this import as a `File-level` option inside our `orders.proto` file.

```diff
...
import "scalapb/scalapb.proto";

+ option (scalapb.options) = {
+  import: "com.rockthejvm.protos.given"
+ };
...
```
Now that everything is set, let's compile our project and take a look at the cases classes generated by `Scalapb`. We'll notice at the top of each of them is our `given` import.

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.protos.orders
import com.rockthejvm.protos.given
...
```
And `Item` and `OrderReply` now have `amount` and `total` for `Item` and `OrderReply` respectively of type `Money`.

```scala
final case class Item(
    name: _root_.scala.Predef.String = "",
    qty: _root_.scala.Int = 0,
    amount: squants.market.Money = com.rockthejvm.protos.orders.Item._typemapper_amount.toCustom(0.0),
    unknownFields: _root_.scalapb.UnknownFieldSet = _root_.scalapb.UnknownFieldSet.empty
    )
```
Let's also make the following change to `OrderClient.scala`.

```diff
  private def processOrders(
      orderStub: OrderFs2Grpc[IO, Metadata],
      orders: Stream[IO, OrderRequest]
  ): IO[List[String]] = {
    for {
      response <- orderStub.sendOrderStream(
        orders,
        new Metadata()
      )
      str <- Stream.eval(
-          IO(s"Processed orderid: ${response.orderid} for items ${response.names
-              .mkString(",")} totaling to USD ${response.total}")
+         IO(s"Processed orderid: ${response.orderid} for items: ${formatItemsToStr(response.items)
+             .mkString(" and ")}, totaling to ${response.total.toString}"
          )
        )
      } yield str
  }.compile.toList
```
Here we use `Squants`' `toString` method which formats our currency values as follows: `xxx USD`.

Lastly, let's edit `AppRoutes.scala` as well.

```diff
...
  given itemDecoder: Decoder[Item] = Decoder.instance { h =>
    for {
      name <- h.get[String]("name")
      qty <- h.get[Int]("quantity")
      amount <- h.get[Double]("amount")
    } yield Item.of(
      name,
      qty,
-     amount
+     USD(amount)
    )
  }
...
```
Here we add `USD(amount)` of type `Money` for our `itemDecoder`.

The application should now run with the updated changes.

## 9. Conclusion
In this article, we've looked at how to create a `gRPC` service in Scala using `Fs2Grpc`, this includes server and client implementations and how they communicate with each other. `gRPC` is particularly popular for communication between microservices and uses `HTTP/2` which provides better performance and reduced latency.

`Scalapb` has a lot more to offer than what's been discussed in this article such as more customizations, transformations, extra sbt settings as well as some extra guides on usage with other Scala libraries, I encourage you to dig into the documentation for more in-depth knowledge on `gRPC` in Scala.

The complete code for this article can be found (in a slightly modified version) over on [GitHub](https://github.com/hkateu/orderbuffer).
