<p>as described below you can use vsp1cln.exe to remove SP1 uninstallation information and recover up to 1Gb of disk space...</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><b>Windows Vista SP1 File Removal tool (Vsp1cln.exe).</b> Vsp1cln.exe is an optional tool that you can run         <br />after you install SP1. This tool removes older versions of components that have been updated in SP1,         <br />which are stored during the installation in case you need to uninstall SP1 later. Saving these older         <br />components increases the amount of disk space that is used. Typically, you should run Vsp1cln.exe if         <br />you want to reclaim this disk space after applying SP1 and if you will not need to uninstall SP1. Note,         <br />however, that you cannot uninstall SP1 after you run this tool. You can use this tool both online and         <br />offline, but you must have SP1 installed and you must use the correct version of the tool. If you are         <br />running this file on an offline image, you should use the Vsp1cln.exe included in the Windows OPK or         <br />AIK. However, if you are running this file online (on a computer that you are booted into), you should         <br />use the Vsp1cln.exe file located at %windir%\system32\vsp1cln.exe.</em></p>    <p><em>More info: </em><a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/5cf710a1-1414-4d11-97de-0748abdcec651033.mspx?mfr=true"><em>http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/5cf710a1-1414-4d11-97de-         <br />0748abdcec651033.mspx?mfr=true</em></a></p></blockquote>
