This talk came just at the right time for many people: MVC frameworks like Backbone and Angular had been around long enough for people to write lots and lots of bad code. I focused on helping people identify pain points in their projects: "Do you ever re-order script tags and hope your code works better?" and matched those with modern solutions (use Require.js or Browserify, in that example).

I advocate a right-sized solution for your application: too much tooling is cumbersome, so add in what you need at the right time, by recognizing when it's time to grow up. I covered templating, object oriented javascript, module systems, MVC frameworks, and more.
