Above all, I found the idea with the UpdateContext exciting, but also that PowerApps query which are identical, only perform every 30 seconds and block all identical queries until then. But to bypass this with a variable is just awesome.

## Key Takeaways from Paul O'Flaherty's Video

- **Performance Issue**: Using Refresh() function repeatedly can severely impact your app's performance
- **Alternative Method**: Use UpdateContext to manage data updates more efficiently
- **Query Optimization**: PowerApps automatically blocks identical queries for 30 seconds - use variables to bypass this limitation
- **Best Practices**: Implement smart refresh strategies to maintain optimal app performance
