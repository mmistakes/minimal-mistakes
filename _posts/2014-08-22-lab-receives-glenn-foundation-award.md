Our lab was selected this year for a [Glenn Award](http://glennfoundation.org/programs/glennawards/). These awards were initiated in 2007 to provide unsolicited funds to researchers investigating the biology of aging, and are sponsored by the [Glenn Foundation for Medical Research](http://glennfoundation.org/).
