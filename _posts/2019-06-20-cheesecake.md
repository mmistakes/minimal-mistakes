There are few things I know from childhood as vibrantly as Mom’s baked goods. In a family of five kids, you quickly learn the social dynamics at play with these desserts. You can only eat the dessert when it’s neither the first piece, nor the last. The [0] piece and the [-1] piece are always off limits. So, you end up in one of Zeno’s paradoxes where the last piece keeps getting smaller and smaller, but the dish is still on the counter. 
This was especially true of her cheesecake. The most important qualities can be distilled to a science, and the ingredients are basic, so it’s a natural topic. Sugar, eggs, and dairy only, but it’s famously difficult to get right.

Every cheesecake crust should be hand crushed and not too fine. Lots of recipes call for a food processor, but that fine texture doesn’t provide a nice crunch at the end of the fork. I’ve only got anecdotal proof, but I think the finer grain also gets squishy and gross sooner in the fridge. 
The quality of the cake itself is dependent on the smoothness of the batter. We also want the batter super soft, which makes it richer in the end. I like to get the cream cheese up to room temperature, and then mix it in the stand mixer alone. When adding sugar and the wet ingredients, scrape the bowl. Scrape the bowl so much. Always scrape the bowl. Scrape the bowl scraper. Once the batter is smooth, it goes onto the crust that isn’t too fine. A gentle shaking of the pan helps the air bubbles rise out of the cake and break on the surface. Here again we’re trying to keep the smoothest batter. 

Traditionalists will insist that cheesecake, which is a custard, should be cooked in a water bath. Two things here. One, you can’t use your springform pan, and getting the cake out after cooking will be a nightmare. The times I’ve tried using a standard cake pan split the crust at the bottom. The improved batter was offset by the reduced crust. Two, finding a pan large enough to hold the pan and a reasonable amount of water can be tough. Nothing makes me crazier than recipes calling for single use equipment or hyper specific ingredients. In the oven at 325° F until the center is barely set. It might not seem done, but many of these delicate desserts continue cooking by residual heat. If your cake sets in the oven, it will be overdone on the plate. This method usually causes the cake to crack, so I cover the top of my cheesecakes with a sour cream and powdered sugar frosting.

Ultimately, if the batter is smooth and the pan is off heat before it sets, the cheesecake should be above average. A couple of the extra steps take it to the next level. These cheesecakes usually come off the fork with no residue and are super rich. The cheesecake is more scared of you than you are of it, so give it a go.
