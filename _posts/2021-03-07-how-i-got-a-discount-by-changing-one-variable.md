# How I got a 20% discount for changing one variable

To begin with: _I hate shopping online with my phone._
And for various reasons: No adblock, visibility (field of view too small), it is slower, too less information, no possiblity to compare

One morning I woke up and had a hurting foot. 
Out of nowhere. Overnight. Evening good. Morning bad. Really bad.
We went to the ER because it felt broken. 
Long story short: X-ray without any anomolies, and after walking on crutches for a few days the pain went away.

My girlfriend (she hates to see me suffer) pointed out, it _maybe_ was my fault for only wearing wornout shoes (which is not true).
To be fair, when it comes to my footware, I am quite pragmatic. 
All the shoes I wear are all the shoes I need.
The shoes I have are one of three kinds: 

- Business shoes (which I do not need currently, because COVID)
- Casual sneaker
- Running/hiking/sport shoes

But I accepted, that it was _maybe_ time for a new pair of shoes that would give a better distribution of pressure on my foot.

It was again my girlfriend who pointed me to the [ON Running The Roger Advantage &nearr;](https://www.on-running.com/de-de/products/theroger-advantage). I really liked the style from the beginning.

Eventhough I do not like shopping on mobile, I like to lay on my couch, my had in the lap of my beautiful girlfriend.

So tl;dr of the story is, I got a 20% discount for pointing out if would be more convinient to set `autocapitalze=true` in the shipping form.
