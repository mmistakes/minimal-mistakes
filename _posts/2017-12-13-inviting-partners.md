## Introduction
This document helps you understand how to invite your trading partners to connect with you and start trading.

### Step One
To invite a partner, you will need their email address and a price list to assign them. In order to invite a partner, you need to create the partner:

#### Fields
* Code: a code for the partner, enter anything you want here
* Email: the email address for your partner to receive the invite
* Price List: the price list you want to assign your partner
* Relationship: is this a drop shipping partner? Use 'child'

### Step Two
Now that you have created a partner, the next step is to invite them. Each partner has a link you can click to invite them:

### Step Three
We will send them an email with a link to sign up. You can see the status of their invitation and whether the invite has been sent on their record.

We recommend that you only activate partners after they are signed up and connected with you. This allows you to ensure you have all the information you need to start trading with them.
