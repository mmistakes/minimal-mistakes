Motorized 2-wheel transportation is pervasive in Cuba. They’re cheap, quick, and easy to maneuver around the crumbling roads. While the rumbling, diesel-retrofitted automobiles of the 50’s and 60’s are the sexy pinup models of Cuban transportation, it’s clear that motorcycles and scooters are the pragmatic choice.

We traveled to Cuba to observe how motorcycles are used and to capture photos of them in their natural habitat.

Among motorcycles, 125cc four-strokes are most common overall. 250cc MZs are also common, while the 350cc Jawa is more rare. The occasional 100cc two-stroke chainsaw whizzes by. Out in the countryside, an Africa Twin rumbled by as part of a touring group and looked like a monster among the smaller Cuban bikes.

When it comes to new bikes, 125cc Suzukis are the clear favorite. The Chinese Ava Jaguar plug-in electric motorcycle is a surprisingly popular new motorcycle.

Nobody is too cool to ride on the back. It’s not uncommon to see a tattooed, punk-rock-styled Cuban on the back of a tiny scooter with his friend. You’ll occasionally see a family of four, including baby, squeezed onto one seat.

Every rider and passenger wears a half-helmet, likely as a legal requirement. Protective clothing such as jackets, pants, and boots are practically unheard-of. The days were quite hot, even in mid-March.

Among the Suzukis, MZs, Jawas, and Avas are the occasional older brand, such as the Russian Karpaty, and various unlabeled 2-stroke hackjobs. Sportbikes are very rare.

As with everything in Cuba, the motorcycles and their locations are obscenely photogenic.
