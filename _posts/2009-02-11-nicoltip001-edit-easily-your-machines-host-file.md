<p>Edit the HOST file in Vista is difficult than ever, thanks to UAC. If you’re a geek that changes HOST file daily this can be a bit frustrating. I circumnavigated the difficulty with a shortcut.</p>  <ol>   <li>Right click on the folder you want to place the hyperlink (i.e. desktop) and select “new-&gt;Shortcut” </li>    <li>As location of the item type: <strong>notepad.exe C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</strong> </li>    <li>As Shortcut name type “Edit HOST file (as administrator)” </li>    <li>right click on the new shortcut just created and select “properties” </li>    <li>Select “Advanced” </li>    <li>Select “Run as Administrator” </li> </ol>  <p>Now, if you need to edit the HOST file (and folder where you put the shortcut is indexed by vista search) just click on start button and type “edit host”</p>
