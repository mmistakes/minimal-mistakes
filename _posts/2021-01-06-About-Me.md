* 4 years in Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
* 7 years in Control Systems, and Academic Research.
* 10 years in Automotive Systems Engineering.

* I love exploring data and uncovering hidden meaning and fallacies, and developing new algorithms to automate solutions to complex problems in code.

* I'm currently developing robots that can reason about the complex manipulation dynamics of deformable objects using active compliance, model predictive control and deep reinforcement learning.

* Developed mathematical models of complex systems such as contact dynamics for deformable objects.

* Built various machine/deep learning models for a range of tasks.

* Improved recurrent neural-network performance by developing new data batching techniques.

* Developed various novel robot controllers using machine learning and deep learning.

* Previously managed engineering teams and projects.

* Experienced in designing and developing mechanical, electrical and software products.
