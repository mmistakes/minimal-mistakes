## Problem

> Create a program that calculates and displays the average of three numbers. The user will enter the three numbers.
>
> <br> Sample calculation:
>
> 1. Sum = first + second + third &rarr; 9 + 7 + 5 = 21
> 2. Average = sum / 3 &rarr; 21 /3

| Input                | Processing                                | Output  |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------ |
| first, second, third | sum                                       | average |
|                      | Algorithm                                 |         |
|                      | 1. Enter first, second and third          |         |
|                      | 2. Calculate sum = first + second + third |         |
|                      | 3. Calculate average = sum / 3            |         |
|                      | 4. Display average                        |         |

## Solution

### IPO Chart &rarr; C# Statements

- Input: first, second, third

  ```
  // Input
  int first;
  int second;
  int third;

  /* int is a keyword that is used to declare a variable which can store an integral type of value (signed integer) the range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. It is an alias of System. */
  ```

- Processing: sum
  ```
  // Processing
  int sum;
  ```
- Output: average
  ```
  // Output
  int average;
  ```
- Algorithm

  - [Console.Write Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console.write?view=net-7.0)
  - [Writing to the Console using Console.Write](https://dotnetcademy.net/Learn/2032/Pages/5)

  1. Prompt for first

  ```
  Console.Write("Enter the first number");
  ```

  2. Accept first

  ```
  first = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
  ```

  3. Prompt for second

  ```
  Console.Write("Enter the second number");
  ```

  4. Accept second

  ```
  second = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
  ```

  5. Prompt for third

  ```
  Console.Write("Enter the third number");
  ```

  6. Accept third

  ```
  third = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
  ```

  7. Calculate sum = first + second + third

  ```
  sum = first + second + third;
  ```

  8. Calculate average = sum / 3

  ```
  average = sum / 3;
  ```

  9.  Display average

  ```
  Console.Write(average);
  ```
