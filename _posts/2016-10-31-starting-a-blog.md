As is seemingly more common in our field of Astrophysics, I am working on making the
transition to Data Science. As part of the learning process for me and information
for others I have decided to start a blog detailing my experiences, projects, and thoughts.

I will try to keep this blog focused on Data Science or programming type posts.
As anyone who interacts with me knows, I have quite a few political opinions and
I will try to keep any posts or rants on those subjects on my
[Medium](https://medium.com/@justinellis18) page.

Coming soon will be a post on my thoughts on the [TDWI Data Science Bootcamp](https://events.tdwi.org/events/san-diego-2016/information/data-science-bootcamp.aspx), writing an MCMC in R,
and a few posts on some analysis that I've done on crime and police shooting data.

*Update October 8, 2017:*
*Ok that didn't work out so well. It turns out that searching for jobs and moving
across the country is quite a lot of work. However, I'm back now, nearly a
year after starting this Blog, to try again. Expect some content from me soon...*
