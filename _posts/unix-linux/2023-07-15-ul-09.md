# Network Communication Utilities

When we work in a distributed environment, we need to communicate with remote users and access remote Unix machines.

There are several Unix utilities that help users compute in a networked, distributed environment.

<br>

# The ping Utility

The `ping` command sends an echo request to a a host available on the network. Using this command, we can check if our remote host is responding well or not.

- Tracking and isolating hardware and software problems.
- Determining the status of the network and various foreign hosts.
- Testing, measuring, and managing networks.

```
$ping hostname or ip-address
```

The above command starts printing a response after every second. To come out of the command, we can terminate it by pressing `CTRL + C` keys.

## Example:

Check the availability of a host available on the network:

```
$ping google.com
PING google.com (74.125.67.100) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq = 1 ttl = 54 time = 39.4 ms
64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq = 2 ttl = 54 time = 39.9 ms
64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq = 3 ttl = 54 time = 39.3 ms
64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq = 4 ttl = 54 time = 39.1 ms
64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq = 5 ttl = 54 time = 38.8 ms
--- google.com ping statistics ---
22 packets transmitted, 22 received, 0% packet loss, time 21017ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 38.867/39.334/39.900/0.396 ms
$
```

If a host does not exist, we will receive the following output:

```
$ping giiiiiigle.com
ping: unknown host giiiiigle.com
$
```

# The ftp Utility

`ftp` stands for File Transfer Protocol. This utility helps us upload and download our file from one computer to another computer.

The ftp utility has its own set of Unix-like commands. These commands help us perform tasks such as:

- Connect and login to a remote host.
- Navigate directories.
- List directory contents.
- Put and get files.
- Transfer files as `ascii`, `ebcdic`, or `binary`.

Use `ftp` command:

```
$ftp hostname or ip-address
```

The above command prompt us for the login ID and the password. Once we are authenticated, we can access the home directory of the login account and we can perform various commands.

| Command        | Description                                                                                                          |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| put filename   | Uploads filename from the local machine to the remote machine.                                                       |
| get filename   | Downloads filename from the remote machine to the local machine.                                                     |
| mput file list | Uploads more than one file from the local machine to the remote machine.                                             |
| mget file list | Downloads more than one file from the remote machine to the local machine.                                           |
| prompt off     | Turns the prompt off. By default, you will receive a prompt to upload or download files using mput or mget commands. |
| prompt on      | Turns the prompt on.                                                                                                 |
| dir            | Lists all the files available in the current directory of the remote machine.                                        |
| cd dirname     | Changes directory to dirname on the remote machine.                                                                  |
| lcd dirname    | Changes directory to dirname on the local machine.                                                                   |
| quit           | Helps logout from the current login.                                                                                 |

Should be noted that all the files would be downloaded or uploaded to or from the current directories. If we want to upload our files in a particular directory, we need to first change to that directory and then upload the required files.

Show the working of a few commands:

```

# The telnet Utility

There are times when we are required to connect to a remote Unix machine and work on that machine remotely. `Telnet` is a utility that allows a computer user at one site to make a connection, login and then conduct work on a computer at another site.

Once we login using `Telnet`, we can perform all the activities on our remotely connected machine.

`Telnet` example:

```
C:>telnet amrood.com
Trying...
Connected to amrood.com.
Escape character is '^]'.

login: amrood
amrood's Password:

# The finger Utility

The `finger` command displays information about users on a given host. The host can be either local or remote. Finger may be disabled on other systems for security reasons.

Check all the logged-in users on the local machine:

```
$ finger
Login     Name       Tty      Idle  Login Time   Office
amrood               pts/0          Jun 25 08:03 (62.61.164.115)
```

Get information about a specific user available on the local machine:

```
$ finger amrood
Login: amrood                           Name: (null)
Directory: /home/amrood                 Shell: /bin/bash
On since Thu Jun 25 08:03 (MST) on pts/0 from 62.61.164.115
No mail.
No Plan.
```

Check all the logged-in users on the remote machine:

```
$ finger @avtar.com
Login     Name       Tty      Idle  Login Time   Office
amrood               pts/0          Jun 25 08:03 (62.61.164.115)
```

Get the information about a specific user available on the remote machine:

```
$ finger amrood@avtar.com
Login: amrood                           Name: (null)
Directory: /home/amrood                 Shell: /bin/bash
On since Thu Jun 25 08:03 (MST) on pts/0 from 62.61.164.115
