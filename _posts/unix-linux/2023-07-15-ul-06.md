# Printing Files

- Before printing a file on a Unix system, we reformat it to adjust the margins, highlight some words, and so on.
- Most files can be printed without reformatting, but the raw printout may not be that appealing.
- Two powerful text formatters &rarr; `nroff` and `troff`

<br>

## The `pr` Command

If we have a long list of names in a file, we can format it onscreen into two or more columns.

```
pr option(s) filename(s)
```

`pr` command changes the format of the file only on the screen or on the printed copy. It doesn't modify the original file.

`pr` options:

| Sr.No. | Option & Description                                                                                       |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | `-k` Produces `k` columns of output                                                                        |
| 2      | `-d` Double-spaces the output (not on all `pr` versions)                                                   |
| 3      | `-h "header"` Takes the next item as a report header                                                       |
| 4      | `-t` Eliminates the printing of header and the top/bottom margins                                          |
| 5      | `-l PAGE_LENGTH` Sets the page length to PAGE_LENGTH (66) lines. The default number of lines of text is 56 |
| 6      | `-o MARGIN` Offsets each line with MARGIN (zero) spaces                                                    |
| 7      | `-w PAGE_WIDTH` Sets the page width to PAGE_WIDTH (72) characters for multiple text-column output only     |

Before using `pr`, the contents of a sample file named food:

```
$cat food
Sweet Tooth
Bangkok Wok
Mandalay
Afghani Cuisine
Isle of Java
Big Apple Deli
Sushi and Sashimi
Tio Pepe's Peppers
........
$
```

Make a two-column report with the header `Restaurants`:

```
$pr -2 -h "Restaurant" food
Nov  7  9:58 1997  Restaurants   Page 1

Sweet Tooth              Isle of Java
Bangkok Wok              Big Apple Deli
Mandalay                 Sushi and Sashimi
Afghani Cuisine          Tio Pepe's Peppers
........
$
```

<br>

## The `lp` and `lpr` Commands

The command `lp` or `lpr` prints a file onto paper as opposed to the screen display. Once we format using the `pr` command, use any of these commands to print your file on the printer connected to our computer.

To print a file named food on the default printer, use the `lp` or `lpr` command:

```
$lp food
request id is laserp-525 (1 file)
$
```

The `lp` command shows an ID that we can use to cancel the print job or check its status.

- If we use `lp` command, we can use the `-nNum` option to print Num number of copies. Along with the command `lpr`, we can use `-Num` for the same.
- If there are multiple printers connected with the shared network, then we can choose a printer using `-dprinter` option along with `lp` command and for the same purpose we can use `-Pprinter` option along with `lpr` command. &rarr; here 'printer' is the printer name.

<br>

## The `lpstat` and `lpq` Commands

The `lpstat` command shows what's in the printer queue: request IDs, owners, file sizes, when the jobs were sent for printing, and the status of the requests.

Use `lpstat -o` if we want to see all output requests other than just our own. Requests are shown in the order they'll be printed:

```
$lpstat -o
laserp-573  john  128865  Nov 7  11:27  on laserp
laserp-574  grace  82744  Nov 7  11:28
laserp-575  john   23347  Nov 7  11:35
$
```

The `lpq` gives slightly different information than `lpstat -o`:

```
$lpq
laserp is ready and printing
Rank   Owner      Job  Files                  Total Size
active john       573  report.ps              128865 bytes
1st    grace      574  ch03.ps ch04.ps        82744 bytes
2nd    john       575  standard input         23347 bytes
$
```

The first line `laserp is ready and printing` displays the printer status. If the printer is disabled or running out of paper, we may see different messages on this first line.

<br>

## The `cancel` and `lprm` Commands

The `cancel` command terminates a printing request from the `lp` command. The `lprm` command terminates all `lpr` requests. We can specify either the ID of the request(displayed by lp or lpq) or the name of the printer.

```
$cancel laserp-575
request "laserp-575" cancelled
$
```

To cancel whatever request is currently printing, regardless of its ID, simply enter `cancel` and the print name:

```
$cancel laserp
request "laserp-573" cancelled
$
```

The `lprm` command will cancel the active job if it belongs to us. Otherwise, we can give job numbers as arguments, or use a dash(-) to remove all of our jobs:

```
$lprm 575
dfA575diamond dequeued
cfA575diamond dequeued
$
```

The `lprm` command tells us the actual filenames removed from the printer queue.

# Sending Email

Use the Unix mail command to send and receive mail:

```
$mail [-s subject] [-c cc-addr] [-b bcc-addr] to-addr
```

Options related to mail command:

| Sr.No | Option & Description                                                                          |
| :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `-s` Specifies subject on the command line.                                                   |
| 2     | `-c` Sends carbon copies to the list of users. List should be a commaseparated list of names. |
| 3     | `-b` Sends blind carbon copies to list. List should be a commaseparated list of names.        |

Send a test message to admin@yahoo.com:

```
$mail -s "Test Message" admin@yahoo.com
```

Then, type in your message, followed by "control-D" at the beginning of a line. To stop, simply type dot(.) as follows:

```
Hi,

This is a test.
.
Cc:
```

Send a complete file using a `redirect < operator` as follows:

```
$mail -s "Report 15/07/23" admin@yahoo.com < demo.txt
```

To check incoming email at your Unix system, simply type email as follows:

```
$mail
no email
```
