# If Statement

The syntax of the if statement is:

```
if conditional_expression
then
 «statements»
fi
```

Unlike python and similar to most other language, indentation is not necessary, however it does make it easier to see structure in your code.

<br>

## Old vs New Syntax

- New syntax use double brackets e.g. `[[ ]]` or `(( ))`
- Old syntax use single bracket e.g. `[ ]`
- I feel that the newer syntax will be easier to understand because of our past programming experiences.
- So we will only use the new double brackets syntax.
- The relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) works as expected.

<br>

## If Statement Using String

```
#simple 'if statement' using sting

if [["$1" == "hello"]]    #we are using string hence [[]]
then
  echo "This first argument is 'hello'"
else
  echo "This first argument was not 'hello'--"
  echo "It was $1."
fi
```

<br>

## If Statement Using Numbers

```
#simple 'if statement' using numbers

if (("$1"%2 == 1))    #we are using number hence (())
then
  echo "$1 is an odd number"
else
  echo "$1 is an even number"
fi
```

<br>

## Nested If Statement

```
#a nested 'if statement'

if (("$1" > 100))   #we are using number hence (())
then
  echo "$1 is a large number"
  if (("$1"%2 == 0))    #start of inner if
  then
    echo "$1 is also even"
  fi    #end of inner if
else    #else block of outer if
  echo "$1 is a small number"
fi    #end of outer if
```

<br>

## More Complex Logic

We can use the Boolean operators `||` and `&&` to create more complex logical conditions:

```
if [["$1" == 'hello']] || [["$1" == 'world']]
then
  echo "The first argument was '$1'"
fi

if [["$1" == 'hello']] && [["$2" == 'world']]
then
  echo "The first argument was '$1' and the second argument was '$2'"
fi
```

## Operators When Working with Files

| Operator | Description                                       |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `-f`     | Checks if the path is a regular file              |
| `-d`     | Checks if the path is a directory                 |
| `-h`     | Checks if the path is a symbolic link             |
| `-b`     | Checks if the path is a block device              |
| `-c`     | Checks if the path is a character device          |
| `-p`     | Checks if the path is a named pipe (FIFO)         |
| `-S`     | Checks if the path is a socket                    |
| `-s`     | Checks if the file exists and has a non-zero size |
| `-e`     | Checks if the path exists, regardless of the type |

# Author: Narendra
#   Name: shell03e.sh
#   Date: April 17, 2023
# Purpose: To demonstrate File Type Operators
#   1) -f -> Regular file
#   2) -d -> Directory
#   3) -h -> Symbolic link
#   4) -b -> Block device
#   5) -c -> Character device
#   6) -p -> Named pipe
#   7) -S -> Socket
#   8) -s -> non-empty file
#   9) -e -> file exist

var1='file1.txt'
var2='folder1'
var3='shortcut.lnk'

rm -i $var1   #erase the file if it exist
#-i prompts for confirmation before deleting the file represented by $var1
rm -ir $var2   #erase the file if it exist
#-ir prompts for confirmation and recursively deletes the directory represented by $var2 along with its contents

#create the file
touch $var1

#check if the file exist
if [[ -e "$var1" ]]
then
  echo "'$var1' does exist"
else
  echo "'$var1' does not exist"
fi

#check if it is regular file
if [[ -f "$var1" ]]
then
  echo "'$var1' is a regular file"
fi

#check if the file exist and has non-zero size
if [[ -s "$var1" ]]
then
  echo "'$var1' is not empty"
else
  echo "'$var1' is empty"
fi

#write something to the file
echo "Hello World" > $var1
if [[ -s "$var1" ]]
then
  echo "'$var1' is not empty"
else
  echo "'$var1' is empty"
fi

#create a directory
mkdir $var2
if [[ -d "$var2" ]]
then
  echo "'$var2' is a directory"
fi

#create a link
ln -s $var1 $var2/$var3
#`ln` creates links, `-s` specifies that we wanna create a link, `$var1` is the source file or directory that we wanna create a link to, `$var2/$var3` is the destination path where we wanna create the link -> $var2 is directory path and $var3 is the name of the link
if [[ -h "$var2/var3" ]]
then
  echo "'$var2/$var3' is a link"
fi
```

# Case Statement

- Both the case and the if statements serves the same purpose.
- If your solution is a simple comparison, then you are better off using an if statement.
- The case statement is inherently more readably.
- Very easy to match patterns against a variable.
  : You may use regular-expression and wildcard characters to define patterns.

The syntax of the case statement is:

```
case expression in
  pattern1)
    statement1
    ;;
  pattern2)
    statement1
    ;;
  pattern3)
    statement1
    ;;
esac
```

<br>

## Case Statement

```
case $1 in
  bye)
    echo Fine,bye #Fine,bye and "Fine,bye" will produce the same result
    ;;
  hi|hello)
    echo Nice to see ya
    ;;
  what*)
    echo Fine, bye
    ;;
  *)    #default case
    echo 'Huh!'
    ;;
esac
```

```
read -p "Enter a command (start, stop, restart): " command

case $command in
  start)
    echo 'Starting the service...'
    ;;
  stop)
    echo 'Stopping the service...'
    ;;
  restart)
    echo 'Restarting the service...'
    ;;
  *)
    echo 'Invalid command'
    ;;
esac
```

<br>

## Case Statement and If Statement

Case Statement:

```
case $fruit in
  apple)
    echo "It's an apple"
    ;;
  orange)
    echo "It's an orange"
    ;;
  banana)
    echo "It's a banana"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unknown fruit"
    ;;
esac
```

If Statement:

```
if [[$fruit == "apple"]]
then
  echo "It's an apple"
elif [[$fruit == "orange"]]
then
  echo "It's an orange"
elif [[$fruit == "banana"]]
then
  echo "It's a banana"
else
  echo "Unknown fruit"
fi
```

# Loops

- Each and every loop must:
  : - First, the variable used in loop condition must be initialized, then execution of the loop begins.
  : - A test (condition) is made at the beginning of each iteration.
  : - The body of loop ends with a statement that modifies the value of the test (condition) variable.
  : - Repeatedly execute a block of statements.
- There are three loops:
  : - for loop
  : - while loop
  : - until loop

The syntax of the for loop is:

```
for var in item1 item2 ... itemN
do
  statement1
  statement2
  statement3
done
```

<br>

## For Loop

```
for num in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo $num
done
```

```
for var in a b c d
do
  echo $var
done
```

<br>

## For Loop Using a Range

```
for var in item[246]
do
  echo -n $var
done

#Output: item2 item4 item6
```

```
for var in item{1...5}
do
  echo -n $var
done

#Output: item1 item2 item3 item4 item5
```

```
output='code.txt'
rm -i $output #what does '-i' do? Asking permission

files='ls * .sh'

for file in $files
do
	echo'================' >> $output
	echo $file >> $output
	echo'================' >> $output
	cat -n $file >> $output #"-n" is number of line
	echo >> $output
	echo >> $output
	echo >> $output
done
```

Output:

```
chmod 744 week05d.sh
/.week05d.sh
#print
#shell01a.sh
#shell01b.sh
#shell01c.sh
#shell01d.sh
# .....
./week05d.sh
cat code.txt
#print
#================
#shell01a.sh
#================
#content of file(3 echos)

#================
#shell01b.sh
#================
#content of file(3 echos)

#shell01c.sh
#shell01d.sh
# .....
#week05d.sh
```

<br>

## For Loop Using List

```
for var in list_of_values
do
  statement1
  statement2
  statement3
done
```

```
values=(a b c d)

for var in ${values[@]}
do
  echo $var
done
```

<br>

## Until and While Loop

While loop:

```
while <<condition>>
do
  statement...
done
```

```
count=1

while (( $count <= 5 ))
do
  echo "Count: $count"
  (( count++ ))
done
```

- The body is processed while the condition is true.
- Prefer this to the `until` loop.

Until loop:

```
until <<condition>>
do
  statement...
done
```

- The body is processed while the condition is true.
- Advise against using this loop.

<br>

# Functions

- Function definitions in shell scripting is similar to method definition in c#. However, you don’t have to specify formal parameters.
  : - Just use the variables $1, $2 etc. in your function
- You may return a value from a function.
  : - You have to access the shell variable $? To obtain the value.
- You may also fake a return value by echo’ing a value and capturing the output of a function in a variable.
- You may use global as well as local variables.
