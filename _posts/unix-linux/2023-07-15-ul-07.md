# Pipes and Filters

Connect two commands together so that the output from on program becomes the input of the next program. Two or more commands connected in this way form a pipe.

- Pipe: Put a vertical bar (`|`) on the command line between two commands.
- Filter: When a program takes its input from another program, it performs some operation on that input, and writes the result to the standard output.

## The `grep` Command

The `grep` command searches a file or files for lines that have a certain pattern.

```
$grep pattern file(s)
```

- `grep` comes from the ed (Unix line editor) command 'g/re/p' which means "globally search for a regular expression and print all lines containing it."
- Regular expression &rarr; plain text(e.g. a word) and special characters used for pattern matching.

Look for a pattern consisting of a single word:

```
$ls -l | grep "Aug"
-rw-rw-rw-   1 john  doc     11008 Aug  6 14:10 ch02
-rw-rw-rw-   1 john  doc      8515 Aug  6 15:30 ch07
-rw-rw-r--   1 john  doc      2488 Aug 15 10:51 intro
-rw-rw-r--   1 carol doc      1605 Aug 23 07:35 macros
$
```

Various options along with the `grep` command:

| Sr.No | Option & Description                                                 |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `-v` Prints all lines that do not match pattern                      |
| 2     | `-n` Prints that matched line and its line number                    |
| 3     | `-l` Prints only the names of files with matching lines (letter "l") |
| 4     | `-c` Prints only the count of matching lines                         |
| 5     | `-i` Matches either upper or lowercase                               |

Use a regular expression that tells `grep` to find lines with "carol", followed by zero or other characters abbreviated in a regular expression as ".\*", then followed by "Aug":

```
$ls -l | grep -i "carol.*aug"
-rw-rw-r--   1 carol doc      1605 Aug 23 07:35 macros
$
```

## The `sort` Command

The `sort` command arranges lines of text alphabetically or numerically.

```
$sort food
Afghani Cuisine
Bangkok Wok
Big Apple Deli
Isle of Java

Mandalay
Sushi and Sashimi
Sweet Tooth
Tio Pepe's Peppers
$
```

Options that control the sorting:

| Sr.No | Description                                                                 |
| :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `-n` Sorts numerically (e.g. 10 will sort after 2), ignores blanks and tabs |
| 2     | `-r` Reverses the order of sort                                             |
| 3     | `-f` Sorts upper and lowercase together                                     |
| 4     | `-k` Specify which fields should be used for sorting                        |

More than two commands may be linked up into a pipe.

List the files in long format, filter for files with a modified date in August using `grep`, and then sort them based on the numeric value of the sixth field using `sort -k 6n`:

```
$ls -l | grep "Aug" | sort -k 6n
-rw-rw-rw-  1 john  doc     11008 Aug  6 14:10 ch02
-rw-rw-rw-  1 john  doc      8515 Aug  6 15:30 ch07
-rw-rw-r--  1 john  doc      2488 Aug 15 10:51 intro
-rw-rw-r--  1 carol doc      1605 Aug 23 07:35 macros
$
```

- ls -l: List the files in long format
- grep "Aug": Filter for files with a modified date in August
- sort -k 6n: Sort them based on the numeric value of the sixth field
  : - 6: Represent the field position. Sixth field is the month or day of the month
  : - n: Specify the sorting types as numeric

## The `pg` and `more` Commands

If we use `more` or `pg` command as a filter, the display stops once the screen is full of text.

```
$ls -l | grep "Aug" | sort -k6n | more
-rw-rw-r-- 1 john doc 8515 Aug 6 15:30 ch07
-rw-rw-r-- 1 john doc 14827 Aug 9 12:40 ch03
-rw-rw-r-- 1 john doc 16867 Aug 6 15:56 ch05
-rw-rw-r-- 1 carol doc 1605 Aug 23 07:35 macros
-rw-rw-r-- 1 john doc 2488 Aug 15 10:51 intro
...
--More--(50%)
$
```
