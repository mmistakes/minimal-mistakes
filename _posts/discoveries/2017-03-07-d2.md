> When I'm not writing I feel an awareness that something's missing. If I go a long time, it becomes worse.

[Jennifer Egan on Writing](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/09/07/jennifer-egan-on-writing/) 
along with three pieces of advice for writers.

I'm thoroughly enjoying [Dan Rather's](http://www.danrather.com/) commentary 
on civil rights, politics, the news industry, and life in general. With his 
decades of experience and an open mind, he provides a non-partisan, empathetic, 
common sense perspective. Find him at your social media of choice: 
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theDanRather/), 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/danrather), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thedanrather/).

[A network of tunnels dating back 1,300 years in Oppenheim, Germany](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/exploring-underground-tunnels-oppenheim-germany-180960147/). 
Only 25 miles have been explored, yet estimates say there are up to 124 
miles of tunnels underneath the town. What an amazing historical find.

Don't set goals, put systems in place to create habits. James Clear discusses 
this perspective in [Forget About Setting Goals. Focus On This Instead.](https://medium.com/personal-growth/forget-about-setting-goals-focus-on-this-instead-718e3e99deaf#.jx01yfp5i).

Society puts a lot of pressure on us to find our _soulmate_ and live happily 
ever after, yet more than 50% of U.S. marriages end in divorce. Even without 
societal pressure, there's the pressure we put on ourselves to make the right 
decision. If you're looking for a little help, [WaitBuyWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com) 
puts it nicely in [The Marriage Decision: Everything Forever or Nothing Ever Again](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/09/marriage-decision.html). 
In a nutshell: 1) like the person, 2) check your gut, and 3) check your list 
of must/cannot haves. _Bonus: this advice applies to other big life decisions too._

How are dimples created, are they inherited, and why do we find them
