## Problem Statement from HoVer-Net
- Mask R-CNN has great performance in clustered image segmentation, becuase Region proposal strategy selects each object and the segmentation process are performed at the each selected regions.
- However, HoVer-Net insists that Mask R-CNN has difficulty in merging instance predictions.
    - Mask R-CNN uses Region Proposal, and Region Proposal selects up 2,000 Region of Interest(ROI), and the segmentation is done in the each selected ROI. 
    - each ROI is already selected considering each single ROI, so it doesn't have to be separating cells furtherly.

As it can be seen in the **2. Extract region proposals**, the region proposals selects ROI.

- HoVer-Net says nucleous locating on the boundary of the ROI (yellow boxes in the image above) could be split into multiple parts and would be located in multiple tiles.

	- Each two tiles which are green boxes has subsegments of nucleous.
    - It requires that left half and right half of the nucleous has te be labeled as one single label, and it takes more efforts to make sure they have identical 



## Solution that HoVer-Net Propses


HoVer-Net uses Overlapping Tile Strategy that U-Net firstly introduced to make segmentation output with seamless.

- Using Overlap Tile Strategy, HoVer-Net doesn't have to consider boundary and also doesn't have to think about the split of the nucleus that requires consistent label in splitted ones.
