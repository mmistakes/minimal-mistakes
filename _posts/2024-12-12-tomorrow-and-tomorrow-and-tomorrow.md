在 *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow* 裡，最讓我難忘的一幕，是男主角 Sam 在捷運月台上欠重重 Sadie 的場景。書中寫道：**"It was as if she were a mathematical proof that had eluded him for many years—but all at once, with fresh, well-rested eyes, the proof had a completely obvious solution."**

你曾經被某些數學曾困住？你的 Aha moment 又是在哪一刻來臨？也許，你人生裡也「想不通的事情」，終有一天也會像那道題明白。
