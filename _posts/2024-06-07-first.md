### 1. 머릿말
You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in [many different ways](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/), but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

### 2. 샘플 코드
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts`[^posts] directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

[^posts]: Footnote test.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
