# today, i will post how to use markdown📚🔥

---
## step1 - title size
---
`#` is make letter bigger like title of contents. and this can make up to six. 


# title1
## title2
### title3
#### title4
##### title5
###### title6
---
## step2 - link
---
you can also link some urls that you want to go pages. 
it just use `[]()`. simply put the url's name between '[', ']' and url between '(', ')'. 

example ==> `[google](www.google.com)` 

the result is [google](www.google.com).

you can go google page when you click the google word. 

And you can also link images on it. it's same method. 
example ==> `[puppy](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2074004/puppy.jpg)`

the result is [puppy](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2074004/puppy.jpg).

## step3 - style of letter + strikethrough(취소선) + quotation(인용구)
---

### 1. style of letter
   
   italic = `*italic*` - result => *italic*

   bold = `**bold**` - result => **bold**

   italic and bold = `***itbold***` => ***itbold***

---
### 2. strikethrough (취소선)

   when you need to make strikethrough. 

   only using ~~ between words is all you have to use. Let's practice

`i made the ~~Dean's list~~, actually i made the Dumb list🥲` 

 result => i made the ~~Dean's list~~, actually i made the Dumb list🥲

---
### 3.quotation(인용구)

using '>' can make a quotation.

practice 

steven jobs's slogan

`> think different`

result =>
steven jobs's slogan
>think different

---

## step4 - list

---
`1. apple
2. bannana
3. pineapple
4. orange
5. strawberry`

result =>
```
1. apple
2. bannana
3. pineapple
4. orange
5. strawberry
```


`- desk `
`- chair`
`- pen`
`- laptop`
`- clock `

result =>
- desk
-chair
- pen
- laptop
- clock
---
## step5 - talbe(표)
---
using '|' this one can make table.      

just think simply that you draw the table.      

  
just like   
  
\| division | man | woman |  
\| --- | --- | --- |   
\| middle | 30 | 20 |  
\| high | 20 | 10 |


result =>

| division | man | woman |
| --- | --- | --- |
| middle | 30 | 20 |
| high | 20 | 10 |

---
## step6 - code block

---
you can put code in your middle of sentence by using Backtick(`)

practice

java = `System.out.println("hello word");` 


\```java  
System.out.print("hello word");  
\```

result =></br>
```java
System.out.print("hello word");
```

it is all what i need to use when i write blog.
Let's practice more and more!!!📚🔥
