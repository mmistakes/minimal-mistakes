It was the first time I assisted to a developers event and I did it as a speaker. It was a challenge for me because I has given the same talk in my previous job office but not in a national event like the Codemotion is. More than 1500 developers sharing their knowledge, their skills, tools, ... and I was there to talk about the architecture VIPER we had been working with in Redbooth during the past months before leaving although I keep using it in my new job.

The **organization** of the event was perfect, time schedule, location of different talks regarding the talk expectancy, food, drinks, internet connection, ... There's something one thing I think that could have been better but is not related with the organization. It's the naming of the talks. I went to some talks after reading the titlte and the description and finally found a different talk that I didn't expect. 

I've to say too that the **level** and the **topic** of talks there was amazing too. Talks related with architecture, some others about testing, talks about tools, or workshops explaining you how to develop apps for Android wearable devices. I attended some iOS talks related with architectures where I was able to learn how other companies organize their code (especially those with a big projects that pay a lot of attention to their code base structure). I was able to **people** I only met from Twitter like @nsstudent or @alvaro_fr and talk a bit in person about our lifes and our current projects.

Regarding the talk I gave I have to say I **wasn't as nervous as some other times before**. I was really relaxed because I enjoyed talking about how to make your projects cleaner and better organized. **However** I did it a bit faster and I had some problems with the project resolution and contacts which didn't allow some attendants to read clearly the code examples on the slides. I was talking after the talk with some Tuenti engineers about different topics related with architecture and which one they are applying on their app. I'm glad to see that I was able to convince some developers **about the importance of taking care of your code** and not doing everything in a ViewController. Some of them contacted me later on Twitter and have started reading and analyzing the example project.

I have to say it was a tired experience because I didn't sleep so much, I had to take the train with my Android Redbooth friends but I **learnt a lot** and got a lot of ideas to apply in my daily work. There's no doubt that I'll try to be there the next year.
