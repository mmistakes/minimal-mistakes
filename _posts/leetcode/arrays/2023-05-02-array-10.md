# Problem

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/511/in-place-operations/3259/)

Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with -1.

After doing so, return the array.

Example 1:

- Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
- Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]
- Explanation:
  - index 0 --> the greatest element to the right of index 0 is index 1 (18).
  - index 1 --> the greatest element to the right of index 1 is index 4 (6).
  - index 2 --> the greatest element to the right of index 2 is index 4 (6).
  - index 3 --> the greatest element to the right of index 3 is index 4 (6).
  - index 4 --> the greatest element to the right of index 4 is index 5 (1).
  - index 5 --> there are no elements to the right of index 5, so we put -1.

Example 2:

- Input: arr = [400]
- Output: [-1]
- Explanation: There are no elements to the right of index 0.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

Hint #1:

Loop through the array starting from the end.

Hint #2:

Keep the maximum value seen so far.

# Solution

## Approach 1

Algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable max_value to -1.
2. Loop through the array from the end to the beginning:
   : - Set the current element to temp(temporary variable).
   : - Replace the current element with max_value.
   : - Update max_value as max(max_value, temp).
3. Replace the last element with -1.
4. Return the modified array.

```
def replaceElements(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    n = len(arr)
    max_val = -1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        temp = arr[i]
        arr[i] = max_val
        max_val = max(max_val, temp)
    return arr

arr = [17, 18, 5, 4, 6, 1]
result = replaceElements(arr)
print(result)  # Output: [18, 6, 6, 6, 1, -1]
```

> - 먼저 최댓값을 -1로 설정하고, 인덱스를 n-1에서 0까지 -1씩 감소시키면서 for 루프를 돌립니다.
> - 현재 인덱스 값이랑 최댓값 비교해서 큰 값으로 업데이트하고 arr 리스트를 반환합니다.

Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array arr.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

# For Better Understanding

## for i in range(n-1, -1, -1)

The line for i in range(n-1, -1, -1) creates a loop that iterates over the range of integers from n-1 down to 0, in reverse order with a step of -1 (decrementing by 1).

In other words, it starts the loop with i equal to n-1, then executes the loop body, then decrements i by 1 and repeats the process until i is equal to -1, which is the stopping condition.

This type of loop is commonly used to iterate over the elements of an array or list in reverse order, from the last element to the first.
