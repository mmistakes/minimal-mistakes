# Problem

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:

- Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
- Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
- Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6]. The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:

- Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
- Output: [1]
- Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and []. The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:

- Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
- Output: [1]
- Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1]. The result of the merge is [1]. Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

Constraints:

- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m, n <= 200
- 1 <= m + n <= 200
- -10<sup>9</sup> <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

Hint #1:

You can easily solve this problem if you simply think about two elements at a time rather than two arrays. We know that each of the individual arrays is sorted. What we don't know is how they will intertwine. Can we take a local decision and arrive at an optimal solution?

Hint #2:

If you simply consider one element each at a time from the two arrays and make a decision and proceed accordingly, you will arrive at the optimal solution.

## Approach 1: Merge and sort

Algorithm:

```
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> None:

        # Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.

        # Write the elements of num2 into the end of nums1.
        for i in range(n):
            nums1[i + m] = nums2[i]

        # Sort nums1 list in-place.
        nums1.sort()

nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
m = 3
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
n = 3

s = Solution()
s.merge(nums1, m, nums2, n)
print(nums1)
```

Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O((n + m)log(n + m))
  : The cost of sorting a list of length x using a built-in sorting algorithm is O(x logx). Because in this case we're sorting a list of length m + n, we get a total time complexity of O((n + m)log(n + m)).
- Space complexity: O(n), but it can vary.
  : Most programming languages have a built-in sorting algorithm that uses O(n) space.

## Approach 2: Three Pointers (Start From the Beginning)

Algorithm:

1. Initialize nums1Copy to be a new array containing the first m values of nums1.
2. Initialize read pointer p1 to the beginning of nums1Copy.
3. Initialize read pointer p2 to the beginning of nums2.
4. Initialize write pointer p to the beginning of nums1.
5. While p is still within nums1:
   : - If nums1Copy[p1] exists and is less than or equal to nums2[p2]: Write nums1Copy[p1] into nums1[p], and increment p1 by 1.
   : - Else: Write nums2[p2] into nums1[p], and increment p2 by 1.
   : - Increment p by 1.

```
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        # Make a copy of the first m elements of nums1.
        nums1_copy = nums1[:m]

        # Read pointers for nums1Copy and nums2 respectively.
        p1 = 0
        p2 = 0

        # Compare elements from nums1Copy and nums2 and write the smallest to nums1.
        for p in range(n + m):
            # We also need to ensure that p1 and p2 aren't over the boundaries
            # of their respective arrays.
            if p2 >= n or (p1 < m and nums1_copy[p1] <= nums2[p2]):
                nums1[p] = nums1_copy[p1]
                p1 += 1
            else:
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
                p2 += 1
```

Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(n + m)
  : We are performing n + 2 \* m reads and n + 2 \* m writes. Because constants are ignored in Big O notation, this gives us a time complexity of O(n + m).
- Space complexity: O(m).
  : We are allocating an additional array of length m.

## Approach 3: Three Pointers (Start From the End)

> Interview Tip: This is a medium-level solution to an easy-level problem. Many of LeetCode's easy-level problems have more difficult solutions, and good candidates are expected to find them.
>
> Interview Tip: Whenever you're trying to solve an array problem in-place, always consider the possibility of iterating backwards instead of forwards through the array. It can completely change the problem, and make it a lot easier.

Algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, p1 and p2, to point at the last element in nums1 and nums2, respectively.
2. Traverse nums1 from the end to the beginning, starting at the index n + m - 1, where n and m are the lengths of nums1 and nums2, respectively.
3. For each index p, compare the values pointed at by p1 and p2.
4. If the value at nums1[p1] is greater than the value at nums2[p2], then write the value at nums1[p1] to nums1[p] and decrement p1.
5. If the value at nums1[p1] is less than or equal to the value at nums2[p2], then write the value at nums2[p2] to nums1[p] and decrement p2.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until either p2 becomes less than 0 or p1 becomes less than 0.
7. If p2 becomes less than 0, then all elements from nums2 have been merged into nums1 and we can stop.
8. If p1 becomes less than 0, then there are still elements in nums2 that need to be merged into nums1. In this case, we can simply copy the remaining elements from nums2 into nums1.

```
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> None:

        # Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.

        # Set p1 and p2 to point to the end of their respective arrays.
        p1 = m - 1
        p2 = n - 1

        # And move p backwards through the array, each time writing
        # the smallest value pointed at by p1 or p2.
        for p in range(n + m - 1, -1, -1):
            if p2 < 0:
                break
            if p1 >= 0 and nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
                nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
                p1 -= 1
            else:
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
                p2 -= 1
```

Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(n + m)
  : Same as Approach 2.
- Space complexity: O(1).
  : Unlike Approach 2, we're not using an extra array.

## Proof (optional)

You might be a bit skeptical of this claim. Does it really work in every case? Is it safe to be making such a bold claim?

This way, it is guaranteed that once we start overwriting the first m values in nums1, we will have already written each into its new position. In this way, we can eliminate the additional space.

Great question! So, why does this work? To prove it, we need to ensure that p never overwrites a value in nums1 that p1 hasn't yet read from nums1.

Words of Advice: Terrified of proofs? Many software engineers are. Good proofs are simply a series of logical assertions, each building on the next. In this way, we can go from "obvious" statements, all the way to the one we want to prove. I recommend reading each statement one-by-one, ensuring that you understand each before moving onto the next.

1. We know that upon initialization, p is n steps ahead of p1 (in other words, p1 + n = p).
2. We also know that during each of the p iterations this algorithm performs, p is always decremented by 1, and either p1 or p2 is decremented by 1.
3. We can deduce that when p1 decremented, the gap between p and p1 stays the same, so there can't be an "overtake" in that case.
4. We can also deduce that when p2 is decremented though, the gap between p and p1 shrinks by 1 as p moves, but not p1.
5. And from that, we can deduce that the maximum number of times that p2 can be decremented is n. In other words, the gap between p and p1 can shrink by 1, at most n times.
6. In conclusion, it's impossible for an overtake to occur, as they started n apart. And when p = p1, the gap has to have shrunk n times. This means that all of nums2 have been merged in, and so there is nothing more to do.
