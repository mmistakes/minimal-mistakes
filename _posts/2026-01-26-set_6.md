### Function
A function is a relation f ⊂ A × B that is functional and serial. <br>
This means that each element of the domain is related to exactly one element of the codomain, and every element of the domain appears in the relation. <br>
f(A) := {f(a) ∈ B : a ∈ A} <br>
Notation: f: A → B <br>

### Range
A range is f(A) := {f(a) ∈ B | a ∈ A}.<br>
The range of f is the set of all elements in the codomain that are related to element of the domain.

### 1 - 1 Function
A one-to-one function is a function in which each element of the codomain is related to exactly one element of the domain.<br>
∀ b ∈ f(A), ∃! a ∈ A : f: A → B

### 1 - 1 Correspondence
A bijective function is a function in which each element of the codomain is related to exactly one element of the domain.<br>
∀ b ∈ B, ∃! a ∈ A : f A → B

### Inverse Function
The inverse function reverses the mapping of the original function f: A → B, so that f⁻¹: B → A
