### Function
A function is a relation $f ⊂ A \times B$ that is functional and serial. <br>
This means that each element of the domain is related to exactly one element of the codomain, and every element of the domain appears in the relation. <br>
$\forall a \in A, ∃ ! b \in B : f: A \rightarrow B$ <br>
Notation: $f: A \rightarrow B$ <br>

### Range
A range is $f(A) := \{f(a) \in B| a \in A\}$.<br>
The range of $f$ is the set of all elements in the codomain that are related to element of the domain.

### 1 - 1 Function
A one-to-one function is a function in which each element of the codomain is related to exactly one element of the domain.<br>
$\forall b\in f(A), ∃ ! a\in A : f: A \rightarrow B$

### 1 - 1 Correspondence
A bijective function is a function in which each element of the codomain is related to exactly one element of the domain.<br>
$\forall b\in B, ∃ ! a\in A : f A \rightarrow B$

### Inverse Function
The inverse function reverses the mapping of the original function $f:A \rightarrow B$, so that $f^{-1}: B\rightarrow A$
