## Writing Ratios

One of the most frequently used mathematical concepts in everyday life is ratio. A baseball player’s batting average is actually a ratio. The slope, or pitch, of a roof on a building may be expressed as a ratio. A percent is a ratio (a comparison to 100). Ratios provide a way of comparing two numbers or quantities.

### <u>Ratio</u>

A ratio is a comparison of two quantities expressed as a quotient. The ratio of "the number a" to "the number b" is written in any of the following ways.

| The ratio | of two              | number |
| :-------- | :------------------ | :----- |
| a to b    | $$ {a} \over {b} $$ | a:b    |

### <u>Example: Writing Ratios</u>

Write a ratio for the word phrase: 8 hours to 2 days.

<u>Solution</u>

$$ {8hr} \over {2days} $$ =
$$ {8hr} \over {48hr} $$ =
$$ {8} \over {48} $$ =
$$ {1} \over {6} $$

### <u>Unit Pricing</u>

Ratios can be applied in unit pricing, to see which size of an item offered in different sizes has the best price per unit.

When ratios are used in comparing units of measure, the units should be the same. {: .notice--info}

## Solving Proportions

### <u>Proportion</u>

A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal.

For example,
$$ {1} \over {2} $$ =
$$ {3} \over {6} $$

In the proportion
$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$ (b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0),

a, b, c, and d are the "terms" of the proportion.

- The "a and d" terms are called the "extremes"
- the "b and c" terms are called the "means"

We read the proportion
$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$
as “a is to b as c is to d.”

### <u>Cross Products</u>

If
$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$,
then the cross products of the proportion, "ad" and "bc", are "equal".

Also, if ad = bc, then
$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$ (as long as b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0).

For a proportion to be true, "the product of the extremes" must "equal" "the product of the means".

If
$$ {a} \over {c} $$ =
$$ {b} \over {d} $$,
then ad = cb, or ad = bc

This means that these two corresponding proportions are equivalent.

$$ {a} \over {b} $$ =
$$ {c} \over {d} $$
can also be written as 
$$ {a} \over {c} $$ =
$$ {b} \over {d} $$

### <u>Example: Solving Proportions</u>

Solve the proportion
$$ {4} \over {5} $$ =
$$ {22} \over {x} $$

| Solution                                   |                                 |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| $$ {4} \over {5} $$ = $$ {22} \over {x} $$ | Start with the given proportion |
| 4 \* x = 22 \* 5                           | Set the cross products equal    |
| 4x = 110                                   | Multiply                        |
| x = $$ {110} \over {4} $$                  | Divide by 4                     |

The solution set is
$$ {55} \over {2} $$

## Direct Variation

"y varies directly as x", or "y is directly proportional to x", if there exists a non-zero constant k such that

y = kx, or equivalently,
$$ {y} \over {x} $$
= k

The "constant k" is a numerical value called the "constant of variation".

In direct variation where k > 0, as x increases, y increases, and similarly as x decreases, y decreases.

### <u>Solving a Variation Problem</u>

- Step 1 Write the variation equation.
- Step 2 Substitute the initial values and solve for k.
- Step 3 Rewrite the variation equation with the value of k from Step 2.
- Step 4 Substitute the remaining values, solve for the unknown, and find the required answer.

### <u>Example: Direct Variation</u>

Suppose y varies directly as x, and y = 45 when x = 30, find "y" when x = 12.

| Solution                      |                                    |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| y = kx                        | Variation equation                 |
| 45 = k \* 30                  | Let y = 45 and x = 30              |
| $$ {45} \over {30} $$ = k     | Divide by 30 and interchange sides |
| $$ {3} \over {2} $$ = k       | Lowest terms                       |
| y = $$ {3} \over {2} $$ \* x  | Variation equation with k          |
| y = $$ {3} \over {2} $$ \* 12 | Let x = 12                         |
| y = 18                        | Multiply and Simplify              |

Thus, when x = 12, y = 18
