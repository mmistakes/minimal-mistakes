# Requirements Monitoring

Requirements live throughout the life-cycle of software development. Monitoring the requirements throughout this life-cycle is crucial. Below are some key milestones and techniques required to keep an eye on during requirements monitoring.

1. Distributed debugging
   : Uncovers errors and determines their causes
2. Runtime verification
   : Determines whether software matches specification
3. Runtime validation
   : Assess whether evolving software meets user goals
4. Business activity monitoring
   : Evaluates whether system meets business goals
5. Evolution and co-design
   : Provides information to stakeholders as system evolves

Incremental development implies the need for incremental validation. Requirements monitoring support continuous validation by analyzing user goal models against the system in use.
