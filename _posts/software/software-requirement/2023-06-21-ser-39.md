# UML Activity and Swim-lane Diagrams

Requirements modeling situations in which a text-based model, even one as simple as a use case &rarr; May not impart information in a clear and concise manner.

In this case, choose from a broad array of UML graphical models.

Two very useful UML diagrams that supplement the use case diagrams:

- UML Activity Diagram
- UML Swimlane Diagram

Re-call that we when documented a use case we used a "Scenario details" to list the specific actions that are required by the actor and the appropriate system responses. These "Scenario details" can be represented by workflow diagrams. Supplements use-case by providing graphical representation of the interaction flow within a specific scenario.

## UML Activity Diagrams

- Similar to flow chart
  : - Rounded rectangles used to represent functions
  : - Diamonds used to represent decision points
  : - Labeled arrows represent system flow transition line
  : - Solid horizontal lines indicate parallel activities, also called synchronization bars.

## UML Swimlane Diagrams

- Variation of activity diagrams used show flow of activities in use case as well as indicating which actor has responsibility for activity rectangle actions
- Responsibilities are represented by parallel line segments that divide the diagram vertically headed by the responsible actor
