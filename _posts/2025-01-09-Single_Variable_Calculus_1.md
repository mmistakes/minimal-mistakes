### 1.1 Geometric interpretation of the derivative

The slope of the tangent line at the point $(x, y)$ represents the derivative of $f(x)$ geometrically.

### 1.2 Tangent line
A tangent is the line obtained by taking the limit of a secant line
as the second point Q (with Q > P) approaches the point P, making their difference tend to zero.

equation of tangent line at $(x, y)$ is $y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$ by the equation of line passing through.

The equation of the tangent line at the point $(x_0, y_0)$ is $y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$,
because it is the straight line with slope $m$ passing through that point.

### 1.3 Formula for the derivative

We can induce the derivative for Formula using this graph.
each points P and Q is $(x_0, f(x_0)), (x_0 + \Delta x, f(x_0 + \Delta x)$.
derivative is the slope of the tangent line, and the tangent line is the limit of the secant line.
$\displaystyle \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$
