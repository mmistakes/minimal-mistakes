        Before opening a new issue please:

        - Verify you have the latest versions of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes
          installed by running `bundle update`.
        - Thoroughly read the theme's documentation at
          https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/
        - Search all issues at https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues
          for solutions and to avoid duplication.
        - Ask for help at https://talk.jekyllrb.com/

        Please include theme version, Jekyll version, public git repository, whether
        you are hosting with GitHub Pages, and the operating system you tested with.

        Issues without a link to a public repository or ZIP file will likely go ignored.
        Being able to see your actual files is necessary to troubleshoot, as most
        issues stem from invalid/missing YAML Front Matter, a mis-configured _config.yml
        file, or problematic site content.

        following these setup instructions:
