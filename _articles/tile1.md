One of the children used different shaped tiles to build a house. For example, they used a square-shaped tile as the main part of the house and a triangular-shaped tile as the roof of a house.

The picture below depicts how they were thinking of 3D objects (a house) in 2D and can infer that this child was comfortable with the difference between adding and taking away a dimension to represent what they wanted to create.

These ideas then led to the question of whether this child would need to be older to have the dexterity to be comfortable with creating a 3D version of her house by slotting these shapes together. She is already happy to create 3D objects in 2D and thus this question is arguably significant to how far her mathematical thinking is able to take her at this stage.

Some shapes that are the same as each other (for example, they are equilateral triangles) are larger than others. It was discussed how this can be shown, whether by placing the smaller triangle on top of the larger one or how the corners are the same and fit into one another. This type of thinking can border onto more complex, mathematical ideas (for an early years student) of area and how depending on the length and height of the shape, there can be different sized areas.

By further going down this train of thought, we can bring in the idea of circles and how this is a shape that, arguably, has an infinite number of tiny sides and an infinite number of "straight" corners. For exmaple, if you draw different shapes inside the circle (e.g a triangle, then a square, then a hexagon) then each shape has less area than the circle. It takes up an amount of the circle but there are still bits around the edge that are being left out. This idea is depicted in the image below.

Each time another shape is added into the circle more of its area is taken up. However, if you were to have another circle and you put a shape in that had twenty sides then you can say that this shape leaves less area (edges) of the circle than the triangle, hexagon and square that can be viewed in the image.

This type of thinking can then pose the idea of how we talk and think of infinity. It can often be shown as continuing a pattern (e.g. 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and so on). As you can see, this pattern of numbers are getting smaller and smaller and so one could argue that if you were to go on forever, then you would eventually get to zero.

This idea links to how if you were to go on forever adding more and more sides to a shape then you would eventually have a circle. This also shows how if you were to continue to go on finding thinner, smaller, triangular areas then you would eventually also find the area of the circle.

Whilst these ideas have became complex, they have began at the same premise, which is 2D shapes and how they can be arranged. So whilst this child's mathematical thinking may be basic to began with, it is arguably a doorway towards my complex ideas which she will be taught much later on in her education.
