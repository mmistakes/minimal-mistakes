Some of the children enjoy making their own "cakes" and following recipe cards when doing so. They discovered that the consistency of these cakes can be changed by adding more of one type of ingredient.

The idea was introduced to the children that it's the **ratio** (the amount of each ingredient relative to each other ingredient) that controls the consistency. For example, imagine a standard recipe requires 150 grams of flour and 10 grams of cinnamon to make 6 cupcakes. If you only wanted to make 3 cupcakes, you would need to halve the amount of each ingredient, so you would have only 75 grams of flour and 5 grams of cinnamon. However, the ratio of cinnamon to flour is still the same (there are 15 grams of flour for every 1 gram of cinnamon), so the cakes, although fewer, should be identical. 

The children were receptive to the idea that the constistency of their cakes would change if they didn't keep a fixed ratio, as well as the idea that if they wanted to make more cakes they understood they would need "more more" flour.

The basic idea of ratio was introduced to the children to help them understand the mathematics behind their recipes and cakes.

It was speculated that introducing the concept of ratios at an early age might help children when it is taught more formally taught later, since they may link it to this real life scenario.
