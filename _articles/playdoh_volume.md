# Making equal shapes in playdough

Playdough is another activity that can engage children with mathematics, mainly when it comes to making and creating shapes.

Using a cutter, they cut the play dough into a circle and were able to identify the name of the shape they had cut. They were then encouraged by their teacher to try and make circles which were equal in size, although one came out larger than the other. The teacher asked them whether these circles were equivalent and they did understand that their playdough circles were not equivalent, which shows that they can identify what equal shapes look like. We can also interpret from this interaction that this child has an understanding of what the word "equal" means. After discussing the idea of equivalence further with their teacher, this child did try to create two equal sized pieces with some success. Afterwards, they communicated that they had created a large circle and a small circle, which further shows their differentiation between different sized shapes and equality.

For this child's playdough, we can also think about whether two shapes or objects are equal in terms of **volume**. For this child and teacher, to check if these two play dough circles are equal they could check on balance scales and pinch bits off the heavier one to make them equal. Then, it doesn't matter how similar the two lumps of playdough are in shape, they are equal in volume and mass.

It's interesting and exciting to hear this child using mathematical terminology to communicate their ideas about what they are doing and what is happening. The teacher at this nursery tries challenging their thinking by introducing new words to them, such as "size" and "equal", as well as asking about what the children mean when they speak, perhaps, more plainly about what they are doing. It is not that when teachers do this they are expecting this child to understand what the word means immediately but instead they are allowing the child to "try out" the word in different contexts and discuss how it might be interpreted or clarified. We can also view this in how we learn and understand mathematical concepts at any level of learning and education.
