# Water and funnels

At one of the nurseries there was an outdoor tap, where the children could fill up whatever they wanted to with water. One of the children enjoyed filling up an empty water bottle with water. However, during this activity they struggled to fill the bottle through the small opening at the top without it spilling out at the sides.

To try to fix this problem, the teacher introduced this child to a funnel and drew their attention to the neck of the funnel and its size. The child understood that this funnel was supposed to make filling up the water bottle more efficient and was eager to put this idea into motion.

As the water bottle was being filled up with the help of the funnel, the teacher asked this child how much water was in the bottle. This child could identify when the bottle was "half full" and "nearly full". This language links with volume; this child is verbalising the volume of water that is in the bottle, and showing some level of mathematical thinking.

Once the water was full, this child enjoyed screwing a cap on to spray different objects, which can show that whilst these activities are fitting with a mathematical context there is still fun going on for these children in their actvities.

Now, looking at the mathematics in more detail behind this activity, one question to ask is: Why does the funnel help this child get water into their bottle?

One reason is that the top of the funnel is much wider than that of the bottle itself and this fixes the child's problem of not being able to hold the bottle at a position where all the water can enter without any spillage. Another reason is that the funnel can hold a lot of water. In plainer terms, which may help explain to a child if you were to talk about this, the funnel "allows" for the water to "wait its turn" to go through the thinner end and then enter the bottle. You could likent his to many people going through one door.

Another part of this acitvity was how much more efficient the water was at going through the funnel. This relates to the speed at which the water was flowing into the funnel. This mainly depends upon the cross section of the thinner part of the funnel at the bottom. To imagine this, you can think about the "stick" of water which comes out at the end.

If we begin to think about this in further detail, we can ask: if the funnel were to begin full, how long would it take to be empty?

Thinking back to the idea that a "stick" of water is coming out of the funnel, we need to consider the size of that "stick" of water after one second in comparison with the decrease of water at the top of funnel in the same second. In plainer terms, we need to think about how much water is decreasing from the top of the funnel and how much water is coming out of the bottom of the funnel in one second. The volume of each will be the same, but the cross section at the top of the funnel (the big circular bit) is bigger than the cross section at the thinner tube part of the funnel. So, a "slice" of large, circular water is being lost at the top of the funnel and the same amount is being lost every second. However, the funnel is triangular at the top and doesnt have the same area all the way down so the "slice" will be different after every second even if the same amount is being lost. This "slice" is going to get smaller in area but thicker in length. This means that the water level of the full funnel is going to down faster and faster after every second, even though the rate at which it flows is going to be the same. These funnel questions have became more complex and are not something you could simply and easily pose to early years children, but it is interesting to think mathematically about what's happening. We can actually relate these types of questions to another section which was about one of the children playing with play dough and talking about equvilance. In both, the idea of volume being conserved with different shapes is being considered.

Relating this back to the child's water bottle, we can think about how this complex idea of the  volume of water in the funnel is the same as how when you go to fill up any regular water bottle with water, as it reaches the top/neck of the bottle, the water begins to fill up much faster. This child could identify when the water was "half full" and when it was "nearly full"; one could assume that they said it was "nearly full" a small amount of time after saying it was "half full" due to the change in the bottles shape at the neck as it fills up faster. We could pose these questions to the children themselves on whether they take any notice of the height of these bottles (or other fillable objects like a bucket) as well as the width and the depth, and possibly introduce them to the idea of the cross section.
