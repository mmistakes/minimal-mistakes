# Fractals

A group of the children were analysing cauliflower and noticed that the smaller parts of the cauliflower that we are able to remove from it, re much like the larger branch of cauliflower, just much smaller. This is a great example of fractals, which are "infinite patterns in which that each section of the pattern is almost identical to the pattern as a whole".

The image below demonstrate this idea of fractals with the cauliflower:

There are many other examples of this within nature,which we can encourage the children to think about. These are things such as broccoli, trees, lightening, the respiratory system or the circulatory system.

We can look at these fractals and think about how the pattern repeats, going back to the cauliflower, having hundreds of the tiny "bumps" making up the slightly bigger "bumps" and then this repeating until you have the whole entire cauliflower. This works particularly well for trees as, they start with the large, thick trunk, which then goes into lots of connected branches. Each of these branches then have their own smaller branches, which will then have even smaller branches, repeating until the end of the tree branch. The image below visualises this in a simple way:

Some more complex examples of fractals are as follows: 

-Romanesco broccoli                
-Sierpinski triangle                                      
-Menger sponge                           
-Koch snowflake ~ this has an infinite perimeter, but a finite area.
-Gabriel's horn ~ this has an infinite surface, but a finite volume.
