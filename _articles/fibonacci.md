One fascinating thing about nature is the occurrence of the **Fibonacci numbers**. The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers starting $$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,...$$. 

We can construct the Fibonacci numbers by first starting with $$0,1$$ and then adding the last digit and the second to last digit to get the next digit. For example, to get the next digit here we would add $$0$$ and $$1$$ to get $$1$$. To get the next digit, we would add $$1$$ and $$1$$ to get $$2$$ and so on.

The first $$20$$ Fibonacci numbers are: $$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584$$ and $$4181$$. These numbers are a good example of the use of a repeated mathematical rule and also occur in nature, making them interesting to talk about with children. 

The Fibonacci numbers can be found in plants. [[In the image below, we can see that … ]]

The Fibonacci numbers can also be used to construct the **golden spiral**. The golden spiral can be seen throughout nature, in the snail shells, for example. The Fibonacci numbers can be used to construct an approximation of the golden spiral as they approximate an important number called the **golden ratio**. The golden ratio $$1.618033…$$ is used throughout mathematics but also in other areas such as art and architecture. The golden ratio can be approximated by the Fibonacci numbers by taking one number in the sequence and dividing it by the previous number in the sequence. As the Fibonacci numbers become larger, this number becomes closer to the golden ratio. We can see this from the table below.

|  Fraction of two subsequent Fibonacci numbers   | Outcome  |
|----------|-----|-------------|
|$$\frac{1}{1}$$| 1 |
|$$\frac{2}{1}$$| 2 |
|$$\frac{3}{2}$$| 1.500000 |
|$$\frac{5}{3}$$| 1.666667 |
|$$\frac{8}{5}$$| 1.600000 |
|$$\frac{13}{8}$$| 1.625000 |
|$$\frac{21}{13}$$| 1.615385|
|$$\frac{34}{21}$$| 1.619048 |
|$$\frac{55}{34}$$| 1.617647 |
|$$\frac{89}{55}$$| 1.618182 |
|$$\frac{144}{89}$$| 1.617978 |
|$$\frac{233}{144}$$| 1.618056 |
|$$\frac{377}{233}$$| 1.618026 |
|$$\frac{610}{377}$$| 1.618037 |
