# Bi-Weekly Updates: 06/26/22 - 07/03/22

I moved into my new apartment this month. It has been a great, if not tiring experience. I am enjoying my new neighborhood very much.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- [**Mentorship Program**](/categories/career/mentorship_program) - I've started a **free** mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.

- **Consulting** - I am considering taking a dive into the world of consulting and building out my own business.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- **Biking -** I just got a bike and I’ve been riding around NYC. If anyone wants to go on a nice long bike ride, I would love to do it!

- **The Four Agreements -** I have just finished “The Four Agreements” by Don Miguel Ruiz, a terrific author. His book “The Mastery of Love” is one of my favorites, and Ruiz never fails to deliver. Every line in this book packs a punch and carries great meaning. I highly recommend this book to everyone, and I hold every agreement in high regard.

- **Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography by Theodore Roosevelt -** I am reading President Roosevelt’s autobiography, which is genuinely marvelous. President Roosevelt was a true gentleman with a kind heart and a strong moral compass. He has also lived a full life, which is what I am currently reading.
