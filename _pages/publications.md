    text: "In a series of Marketing Analytics projects, I used Online Retail II dataset to create cohorts based on monthly data, calculated retention rates and visualized them via a heatmap. Then I created RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segments, calculated RFM Score for each customer and segmented into 3 custom segments 'Top', 'Middle' and 'Low' based on the total RFM Score. Finally, I calculated the revenue-based CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) for each customer."

    title: "Purchase Analytics"
    text: "In this project, I analyzed purchase behavior of customers that bought 5 different brands of chocolate bars in a physical FMCG store during 2 years. In total, they made 58,693 transactions, captured through the loyalty cards they used at checkout. Based on the results of customer segmentation, I explored the segments sizes and answered the following business questions: 1. How often do people from different segments visit the store? 2. What brand do customer segments prefer on average? 3. How much revenue each customer segment brings?"

The datasets provided by Figure Eight contain real messages sent during disaster events and their respective categories. The task was to train the supervised ML classifier to automate categorization of the new messages so that different disaster relief agencies would receive only relevant ones. The model was then deployed as a Python Flask app to Heroku."

My **Facebook Ad campaign** took place between May 24-May 27, 2020 (3 days) and had a total budget of $100. The objective was to generate leads and collect  new email addresses from prospective Digital Marketing Nanodegree students. The results exceeded expectations - 1056 emails collected with CTR of 1.38%, average CPC $0.07 and final cost of $76.29, saving 24% of the original budget.The **Google AdWords search campaign** advertised free course 'Differential Equations in Action' in India and run for 5 days with budget of $10/day. Campaign did not result into conversions (measured as # of enrollments into the course) but generated 93 clicks with average CTR of 3.46% and average CPC of $0.55."

I worked with real-life data provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form."

The application allows you to choose one of the pretrained architectures, specify different hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden layers, epochs) and use either GPU or CPU for training. I also implemented saving the checkpoints so that you can continue training if stopped. Image Classifier predicts 102 flower categories. "
