## Ezequiel Álvarez

Ezequiel Álvarez, on my mother's side, performed with the **original Mariachi Vargas**, one of the most influential ensembles in the history of mariachi music. Being part of Mariachi Vargas meant contributing to a foundational era of regional Mexican music—a period that shaped the genre as it spread across Mexico and the world.

Much of what we know about him comes from family stories and fragments passed down over the years. Even without a complete historical record, the impact of his musicianship is still felt. Knowing that he played many of the same sones, rancheras, boleros, and huapangos that I perform today creates a musical bridge across generations.
