## Course Components

### Class Meetings (5%):

Student active engagement and ongoing feedback is welcomed and expected.

### Projects (4 x 7.5% = 30%):

You will be asked to complete 4 increasingly complex programming 
assignments over the course of the semester. Duration of these 
projects will be approximately 2 weeks.

### Lab Meetings (10%):

This semester the lab meeting content will be shaped by the programming 
projects. They will be a perfect opportunity for students to discuss 
design ideas and directions with course staff, and to receive 
debugging assistance. Marking will be based on attendance.

### Exams (15% + 25%):

There will be one midterm and one final exam in the course. Midterm 
is scheduled for Oct 24, in class. The final exam is scheduled by 
the university. We expect to announce its details by Nov 1.

### Problems of the Day (50 x 0.30% = 15%):

We believe that programming fluency comes with regular practice. 
To reinforce the concepts we introduce in the classroom, and to build
fluency, we will be assigning short daily exercises for you to 
complete. These exercises, referred to as POTD, will likely take 
around 15minutes. You will complete the POTD using an online tool
called repl.it, and submit your response to another tool called
Gradescope for very light autograding.
