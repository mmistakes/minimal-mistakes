## Lopez Lineage

On my dad’s side, music lives in family gatherings. My grandfather and his brothers would always bring out guitars, bass, and requinto, singing corridos and mariachi until the very last guest went home. These family parties became small concerts, full of laughter, stories, and improvised harmony.

My dad followed in their footsteps when he joined a mariachi group during his university years. Growing up, I constantly saw framed photos of him in traje, violin in hand, surrounded by his group. As soon as I was old enough to hold an instrument, he began teaching me violin and passing down the songs he learned.

This page will gather family photos, stories, memories, and anecdotes from the Lopez side. It represents the informal, living soundtrack that shaped my understanding of music long before I ever stepped into a rehearsal room.
