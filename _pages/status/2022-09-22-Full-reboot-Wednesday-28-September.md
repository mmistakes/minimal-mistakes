<!-- # Full reboot of the system Wednesday 28 September -->


**Update 27-09-2022**:
The full system reboot initially targeted this Wednesday 28 September is postponed to a later date. 

Part of the acceptance of LUMI, a full reboot of the system is targeted on Wednesday 28 September. The system should be available again on Thursday 29 September.
During this short break, no part of LUMI will be available. The update should not affect any user data on the filesystems. We will make a maintenance reservation to ensure no jobs are running when the service break starts. Shorter jobs may run before the break if they can finish before the start of the maintenance.
Please do not hesitate to contact the LUMI User Support Team [https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/need-help/) if you need any assistance.
