title: Things I like
---

This page is a living document where I list things I really like. Fundamentally, it's a list of lists, because for certain material I use tools to keep track of items. For others, I couldn't conceive a better way than to list them here directly. My goal is just to have a single place where to keep track of everything, and to share with anyone who might be interested.

I'm quite obsessed with making lists, so here goes.

## Movies & shows

For movies and shows, I use **The Movie Database** - here are my [lists](https://www.themoviedb.org/u/martina.physics/lists) of favourites.

## Books

For books, I use **goodreads**, here are my [lists](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/92719498?ref=nav_mybooks) - the read books may have a review I wrote, I have started doing this just recently so I may fill in older ones retrospectively, if I still feel the memory is fresh enough. I don't review everything though.

## Podcasts

To listen to podcasts, I use Pocket Casts, but because the amount of them I either subscribe to (not necessarily listening to them) or have finished has grown to be quite unwieldy, I have decided to list here the ones I really love(d) - this doesn't include podcasts used for learning language (see below).

### In English

#### Culture & various things

* [Planet Progress](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGFuZXRwcm9ncmVzcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw) (spring 2021, finished): a podcast about the winners of the Google Impact Challenge, organisations and small businesses who are working towards a shift to a sustainable future. Narrated by Hannah Fry
* [Desert Island Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr) (ongoing): I'm sure this is very well known by any Briton, but it was a lovely surprise for me (though something tells me that we have something similar in Italy). The host has a very enjoyable conversation with a guest that is asked to bring 10 tunes they love, and explain the choice behind each. The guest is usually someone well known, though not necessarily to me, so I normally listen to the episodes where I know the person
* [The David McWilliams podcast](https://davidmcwilliams.ie/podcast/) (ongoing): exploring and explaining economics via the analysis of current news, it's very enjoyable
* [More or Less: behind the statistics](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrss1/episodes/downloads) (ongoing): BBC Radio 4 podcast hosted by Tim Harford, it debunks statistical myths, talks a lot about how to interpret data correctly in a very lighthearted way
* [The curious cases of Rutherford & Fry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g) (ongoing): hosted by Adam Rutherford and Hannah Fry on BBC Radio 4, this podcast explores science's interesting facts and answers to people's curiosities
* [Today, Explained](https://www.vox.com/today-explained) (ongoing): from the Vox team of the Explained Netflix documentary show, a podcast that dissects news and current affairs

#### Stories

* [The big steal](https://www.thebigstealpodcast.com/) (ongoing?): by G. Esler, this is the story of the Russia of today, a very interesting reconstruction of what happened since the fall of the Soviet Union that led to effectively a plutocracy. I've listened to this after a recommendation in spring 2022 and I found it very interesting, I'm not 100% sure whether there will be new seasons but I believe so.
* [Wind of change](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/) (2020, finished): this is a bit out there but I decided to listen to it as it has been ideated by P Radden Keffe, whose investigative journalism work I read and appreciated. It follows and tries to investigate the rumour that the Scorpion's song "Wind of change" was written/commissioned by the CIA for propagandistic reasons. It is an interesting listen - I really hate conspiracy theories so would have never chosen this podcast but despite the wild story you can learn a lot of things about those times.


## Articles - written stuff

To store things I read on the Internet that I really enjoyed, I use Refind - my library with links categorised into topics [here](https://refind.com/library).

## Language learning - resources

There's plenty of resources to learn languages online (some are obvious), but here the ones which really made a difference for me.

### German

* I am following the courses of the [Deutsche Welle](https://learngerman.dw.com/en/overview), they're really good as they lead you through your learning in an engaging yet serious way
* I use Duolinguo too, but only coupled with grammar studying and the above
* I am also using (with much fun) the [podcast](https://coffeebreaklanguages.com/coffeebreakgerman/) from the Coffee break series, it's really well made and very useful!

## Cooking 

The [CookBook app](https://thecookbookapp.com/) is great.
