## Welcome to my Attempt at Learning Linear Algebra
In this category, I will be attempting to go over topics and concepts which relate to linear algebra.
Most of the posts will look more like notes, with questions and points of reference for later.
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any resource you believe I should look into.

## Resources Used:
My primary resource is currently 3Blue1Brown's video series called *Essence of Linear Algebra*.
A lot of what I am writing about will be what I pick up from the videos,
along with external resources I find on the interweb.
Check him out, he has some exceptional work.
