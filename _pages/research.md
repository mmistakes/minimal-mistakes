I am interested in Teichmüller theory, Riemann Surfaces and complex geometry.

### Current Work

- **Kähler geometry of the Weil–Petersson metric**  
  Ongoing reading project under Prof. Sumio Yamada.
- **Bounded Distortion Conjecture for Once-punctured Torus** 
  Ongoing reading project under Prof. Subhojoy Gupta.
### Bachelor's Thesis

- **Decorated Teichmüller theory: Towards Bounded Distortion Conjecture**
  Wrote a review of the Bounded Distortion Conjecture which was proposed by R.C. Penner. R.C. Penner defined a self-map on the decorated Teichmüller space relating a combinatorial construction and Strebel differentials.
  He asked if the map had a bounded distortion with respect to the  Teichmüller metric.
### Projects
- **Foundations of complex Geometry**
- **Introduction to Algebraic Topology**
- **Multivariable Calculus and Fourier Analysis**
