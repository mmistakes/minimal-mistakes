## My Journey

I began my musical life on classical violin, practicing études, orchestra parts, and solo pieces for years. In high school, I stepped away from classical music and moved toward digital production, experimenting with hip hop–inspired beats and learning how to shape sound using a computer.

When I arrived at Notre Dame, I returned to my roots by joining the university’s mariachi group—mirroring my dad’s path. From there, my musical world expanded. I learned harp, picked up guitar inspired by the corridos and boleros my grandfather played, and eventually helped form a **corridos tumbados** group on campus.

More recently, I’ve fallen in love with **huapangos**, drawn to their energy and rhythmic intensity. My musical identity now stretches across classical training, mariachi tradition, digital production, and regional Mexican styles.

This page documents that evolving path—with reflections, photos, and performances marking the moments that shaped how I play and why music matters to me.
