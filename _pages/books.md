- **The Righteous Mind**: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion
<br/> *Jonathan Haidt*
- **There is No Planet B**: A Handbook for the Make or Break years
<br/> *Mike Berners-Lee*
- **Sapiens**: A Brief History of Humankind
<br/> *Yuval Noah Harari*
- **The Most Good You Can Do**: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically
<br/> *Peter Singer*
