## What We Do

We are a computational biology research group in [SIPBS](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/strathclydeinstituteofpharmacybiomedicalsciences/whatissipbs/) ([Strathclyde Institute for Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/strathclydeinstituteofpharmacybiomedicalsciences/whatissipbs/)), at the [University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland](https://www.strath.ac.uk). We apply computational and mathematical approaches to better understand biology. Our main areas of research are in microbiology, human health, and plant health, and we have experience in a number of areas, including:

- genomics
- systems biology
- metabolic modelling
- software development
- phylogenetics and phylogenomics
- statistics (frequentist and Bayesian) and modelling
- synthetic biology
- protein sequence-structure-function analysis
