intro:
  - excerpt: 'OpenPGP is the most widely used email encryption standard. It is defined by the OpenPGP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as a Proposed Standard in [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880). OpenPGP was originally derived from the PGP software, created by [Phil Zimmermann](http://philzimmermann.com).'
