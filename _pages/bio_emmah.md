## PhD Candidate

Originally from England, Emma obtained a BSc (Hons) in Biochemistry from the University of Surrey. Her undergraduate degree included a 12-month industrial placement at GlaxoSmithKline’s Medical Research Centre (Hertfordshire, England), working within the Protein and Cellular Sciences department to design and generate candidate protein targets. Afterwards, in September 2019 Emma moved to St Andrews as a PhD student under the joint supervision of Dr Tracey Gloster (St Andrews), Dr Leighton Pritchard (Strathclyde) and Dr Sean Chapman (James Hutton).

Emma's research focuses on data mining genomes to identify carbohydrate processing enzymes (CAZymes) for industrial exploitation in biofuel production. Specifically, Emma uses bioinformatics techniques to data-mine fungal genomes to identify potential plant cell-wall degrading enzymes. Emma is also exploring the evolution of CAZomes (all CAZymes within genomes of interest) in plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Understanding these repertoires of enzymes may influence the design of enzyme cocktails for industrial degradation of biomass, and elucidate the evolutionary arms race between plant host and pathogen.

Emma's laboratory work includes: 
- Using X-ray crystallography techniques to resolve the structural fold of novel plant cell-wall degrading enzymes
- Design enzymatic assays to 
- Use synthetic biology approaches to optimise CAZymes carbohydrate processing properties of potential use in biofuel production.

In addition to her research, Emma has helped at several Software Carpentry workshops, hosted by the [Industrial Biotechology Innovation Centre (iBioIC)](https://www.ibioic.com/) and the [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://www.software.ac.uk/).

Outside university, Emma frequently goes hiking in the Scottish wilderness, knits and plays video games.
