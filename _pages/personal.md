I created and developed the Python Tool for Micrometeorological Analyses:
[Pymicra](https://tomchor.github.io/pymicra/index.html). This is an open-source
project hosted on github that you can use of and contribute to.

My other side projects can also be accessed using my [Github page](https://github.com/tomchor). Most are
for personal use but they are all open-source and anyone can use them if they
wish to.

I am also interested in communicating science in general. Below is a video that I created
along with [TED-Ed](https://ed.ted.com/):
