Here you can find a non-exhaustive list of projects that I pursue mostly on my free time. Feel free
to reach out if you're interested in any of them.


## Oceananigans

I'm a regular contributor to
[Oceananigans](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/), a Julia package that
provides an efficient and user-friendly way to run large-eddy simulations (among other things) on
[CPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) and
[GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit). I also created a companion package
[Oceanostics](https://github.com/tomchor/Oceanostics.jl), which provides easy diagnostics to
Oceananigans.



## Science communication

I am also interested in communicating science in general. Below is a video that I created
along with [TED-Ed](https://ed.ted.com/):

## Ocean_cheatsheet

I started a quick [physical oceanography cheat sheet at
gitlab](https://gitlab.com/tomchor/ocean_cheatsheet/-/wikis/home) that lists and explains
some useful equations, relations, etc. in a very brief manner. I created it mainly for
personal use and it's still a work in progress that I populate as I need, but contributors
are welcome.



## Pymicra

I created and developed the Python Tool for Micrometeorological Analyses:
[Pymicra](https://pymicra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is an open-source project hosted on
github that you can use and contribute to.



## Others

My other side projects can also be accessed using my [Github page](https://github.com/tomchor). Most
are for personal use but they are all open-source and anyone can use them if they wish to.
