## Adam R. Rivers, PhD - PI (SY)
_PhD Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 2009_

I am a microbial ecologist turned computational biologist. I began my career
woking on nutrient limitation in marine phytoplankton and became involved in
metagenomics early. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill I applied
metatranscriptomics to understand the fate of oil and gas released. In 2014 A
became a research scientist at the Joint Genome Institute, a part of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory. I was the head of the Metagenome Program at JGI
until 2017.  In January of 2017 I joined the Agricultural Research Service to
start a group in the Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit focused on
microbiomes and applied machine learning in agriculture.

Agriculture is an exciting field to apply microbiome methods. A key question in
microbiome research is how the genetics of the host and the ecology of the
microbial community interact. Plant breeders have extensive pedigree and
genotypic information that enables us to start unraveling the interaction
experimentally. Microbiome analyses is poised to upend conventional methods for
food safety allowing us to track and eliminate pathogens, develop agricultural
systems that limit their impact through environmental manipulation. Agriculture
in an area where microbiome science will have a tremendous impact.

At the USDA Agricultural Research Service I hold a career scientist position as a
[Computational Biologist in the Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit.](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/stoneville-ms/genomics-and-bioinformatics-research/people/adam-r-rivers-phd/)

I have a courtesy faculty appointment in the
[Department of Microbiology and Cell Science](https://microcell.ufl.edu/)
and an affiliation at the [Emerging Pathogens Institute](https://www.epi.ufl.edu/)
at the University of Florida.

## Karla Franco Melendez, PhD
_PhD Arizona State University, 2020_

Dr. Franco Melendez graduated in June 2020 from the Microbiology doctoral
program Arizona State University. Her PhD dissertation centered in
characterizing the effect of physiologically relevant fluid shear levels on the
human enteric pathogen _Salmonella Typhimurium_. Specifically, she studied the
effect of fluid shear on pathogenesis-related stress responses and changes in
gene expression across different phases of growth. In July 2020, Dr. Franco
Melendez joined the USDA-ARS as a post-doctoral fellow in bioinformatics, under
the supervision of Dr. Adam Rivers. Her current position focuses on engineering
soil microbial consortia with inhibitory phenotypes against the phytopathogen
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ using new Bayesian optimization algorithms and deep
learning methods. Additionally, she is currently performing a comparative
analysis on the intestinal microbial community composition and antimicrobial
profile of poultry specimens from the pre- and post-antibiotic eras.

## Sveinn Einarsson, PhD
_PhD Old Dominion University, 2021_

Dr. Einarsson is is a University of Florida postdoc using Bayesian networks
constructed from metagenomics and exo-metabolomics data to model microbe
metabolite interactions in a tomato pathogen system using _Ralstonia solanacearum_.

## Ian Rambo, PhD
_PhD, University of Texas Austin_

Dr. Rambo is joining the group this summer and  working on a jointly advised
project with the [Food Processing and Sensory Quality Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/new-orleans-la/southern-regional-research-center/food-processing-and-sensory-quality-research/) in New Orleans, LA to develop better food  allergy diagnostic tests. Using data from arrays
of food allergen peptides and protein structures from AlphaFold he is designing
3D convolutional neural networks to predict allergic reactions to foods.
