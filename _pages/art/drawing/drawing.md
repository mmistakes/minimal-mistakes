I remember a conversation I had with my older brother some time ago,
he told me I should dabble at drawing.
Not because either of us are particularly talented.
Instead, it was to help us think about things in a different way.
When you draw something as simple as a chair, you have to think about so many different components of that chair.
In this way, by drawing, we can exercise being attentive to details.

When I first started my [Linear Algebra]({{"/categories/math/linear_algebra" | prepend:site.baseurl}}) series,
I realized that I am terrible at drawing in 3-D.
So to get better I decided to draw things in my house.
You will find the results below.
