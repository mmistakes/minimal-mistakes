## 🌱 From Setbacks to Growth

### The First Challenge (2019)

In 2019, I attempted to transition from a liberal arts background to an IT Master's program in New Zealand. With enthusiasm and determination, I enrolled in statistics courses alongside my IT studies. However, I faced significant challenges—failing two statistics courses left me deeply discouraged. 

When COVID-19 emerged shortly after, I made the difficult decision not to return to campus. Despite studying hard and genuinely enjoying the material, the results were disappointing. I felt like I had let myself down.

### The Turning Point (2024)

In 2024, I discovered an opportunity to apply to Korea National Open University's overseas admission program. This felt like a second chance—a way to overcome my past experience and prove to myself that I could succeed.

This time, I approached my studies differently:
- **Self-paced learning**: Online courses allowed me to learn at my own speed
- **Flexible schedule**: I could replay lectures until concepts clicked
- **Better alignment**: The learning environment matched my learning style

The results spoke for themselves: **perfect 4.5/4.5 GPA across all courses**.

### What I Learned

**About Learning Styles:**
The traditional classroom setting, where I had to keep up with real-time lectures regardless of comprehension, wasn't ideal for me. Online learning gave me the flexibility to:
- Pause and review complex concepts
- Progress faster through familiar material
- Maintain consistent self-discipline without physical supervision

This realization led me to pursue Georgia Tech's OMSCS—another high-quality online program that matches my learning style.

**About Resilience:**
Failure isn't final. My 2019 experience taught me that setbacks can be valuable learning opportunities. The key is understanding what went wrong and adapting your approach.

**About Self-Management:**
Studying independently requires strong self-discipline. Over two years at KNOU, I've proven to myself that I can maintain academic rigor even without the structure of a physical classroom.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Leadership

### Team Project Experience (2019)

During my postgraduate certificate program, I participated in a team project to build a web blogging system. This experience taught me valuable lessons about collaboration:

**Project Management:**
- Applied Agile methodology
- Defined clear roles for each team member
- Used Trello for continuous progress tracking
- Held regular meetings for coordination

**Key Lessons:**
- **Transparency**: Share problems with the team rather than hiding them
- **Flexibility**: Accept technical feedback and adapt
- **Completion**: Seeing a project through to the end, despite challenges

While I don't have formal work experience, this project demonstrated that I can:
- Work effectively in a team environment
- Communicate technical challenges clearly
- Contribute to a shared goal

## 🎯 Why OMSCS?

My journey has led me to OMSCS for several reasons:

1. **Learning Style Match**: Online format allows me to learn effectively
2. **Depth & Application**: Team projects and paper reviews will help me deepen and apply theoretical knowledge
3. **Proven Track Record**: My KNOU experience shows I thrive in online environments
4. **Clear Goals**: I want to specialize in algorithms, systems, and data-intensive computing

Over the past two years, I've built a strong CS foundation. Now I'm ready to go deeper, work on real projects, and collaborate with a diverse cohort of students from around the world.
