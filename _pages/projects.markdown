Most of our topics revolve around the application of [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) principles
and technologies in the aforementioned information systems. The topic of our research are:
- Conceptual modelling, ontology design
- Linked data, Semantic Web
- Semantic data integration
- Semantic Web-based information systems and software libraries
- Ontology-based information extraction from text

## Semantic Vocabulary Management Tool for Urban Planning Data (OPPPR FEL ICT)

The project lasted from 1st January 2018 to the 30th June 2020 and dealt with the development of a vocabulary and the semantic model in the Urban Planning domain. Project partner was Prague Institute of Planning and Development. During the project was used and further developed a Semantic Vocabulary Management Tool called Termit. In the project it was used exclusively for development of ontologies describing Urban Planning Data.

## Research of Intelligent Components for Safety Data Collection and Processing Systems (17sic4sms)

The goal of the project is to expedite, simplify and make more accurate the process of risk analysis and control
as well as achieving more accurate safety performance monitoring for aviation organisations.
To achieve the goal, intelligent components for existing solutions will be established as a software based on STAMP systemic safety model,
which will be conceptualised into machine-readable form with subsequent domain specification for aviation.
The goal corresponds to national priority No. 3.2 regarding process safety and reliability reinforcement.
The project duration lasted from the 1st November 2017 to 31st October 2019.

## Open Data and semantic approaches to uncover social aspects of urban quality (GISON)

The project deals with the support of intelligent control of public interest, with applications in the field of spatial planning. Existing public data are not interconnected or consistently visualized, which limits their use and makes finding connections necessary for conceptual planning. The main outcome of the project will be innovative ontological geographic information system providing support for planning and providing a platform for public participation in the management of public interests in the region.

Project started from the 1st February 2015 and ended on the 30th June  2017.
