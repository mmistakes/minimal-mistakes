## Ana María González

On my mother’s side, music stretches back generations. My great-great-grandmother, **Ana María González**, was a celebrated singer whose albums, recordings, and memoirs have been passed down through the family. Her book, *Mi voz y yo: Memorias* (1955), along with old photographs and stories, provides a window into the artistic world she inhabited.
