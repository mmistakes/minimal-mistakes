## 💫 My Story

I took an unconventional path to computer science. After an earlier attempt at an IT Master's program that didn't work out, I returned to academics in 2024 with renewed determination and a clearer understanding of how I learn best.

Through Korea National Open University's online program, I discovered that self-paced learning suits me perfectly—achieving a 4.5/4.5 GPA across all courses. This experience showed me that the right environment can transform challenges into opportunities for growth.
