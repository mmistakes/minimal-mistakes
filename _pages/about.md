Hello my name is **Tyler Pollard**! I am 25 years old and I am from *Baltimore, MD*. I graduated from **Clemson University** with a degree in *Mechanical Engineering* and a minor in *Mathematical Sciences*. Since graduating I have been working for the Army Evaluation Center at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland where I transitioned into the world of STATISTICS!! I have been learning as much as I can from my coworkers as well on my own, and I am going to continue my statistics journey in the Masters of Statistics program at **NC State**!
