## About This Project

This website was created as a final project for the **Code in Context** course at the University of Notre Dame. The assignment encouraged us to explore a technical workflow or technology in greater depth and use it for a creative or critical project.

I chose **Jekyll** and the **Minimal Mistakes** theme to build a small static site that functions as a family musical archive. Rather than coding for coding’s sake, this project uses web tools to tell a story about legacy, memory, and identity showing how digital spaces can preserve and elevate cultural histories

Throughout the process I learned how static sites work, how themes are structured, how to customize navigation and layouts, and how to incorporate multimedia into a cohesive narrative. This site is part tribute and part creative experiment, blending music, storytelling, and technology into one space.
