## In Brief

The Finnish Quantum Computing Infrastructure (FiQCI) was established in 2020, when it became part of the Finnish Research Infrastructure (FIRI) roadmap of significant national research infrastructures within the Finnish research infrastructure ecosystem, maintained by the Academy of Finland.

The mission of FiQCI is to provide state-of-the-art quantum-computing services such as computing time and training to the Finnish RDI communities. This includes providing a hybrid high-performance computing and quantum computing (HPC+QC) platform for developing, testing, and exploiting quantum-accelerated computational workflows. Through FiQCI, Finnish researchers have access to one of the most powerful hybrid HPC+nQC resources in the world, available for quantum accelerated research and development. The infrastructure also aims to offer possibilities to carry out experiments in quantum physics.

FiQCI is jointly maintained, operated, and developed by **VTT**, **Aalto University**, and **CSC – IT Center for Science**.

## Components

### LUMI supercomputer

The backbone of the classical HPC resources in FiQCI, and the portal for quantum computing resources, is the pan-European EuroHPC LUMI supercomputer. LUMI is the fastest and greenest supercomputer in Europe, hosted by CSC in Kajaani, Finland. For more information, see [https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/)

### Helmi quantum computer

Helmi, the first Finnish quantum computer, is operated by VTT. Presently, Helmi provides five qubits, and will be upgraded to 20, then 50 qubits in the near future.

### Other resources

Other quantum resources will continuously be added to the FiQCI infrastructure.
