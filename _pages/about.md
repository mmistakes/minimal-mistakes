Hey there 👋 I’m Anup, an iOS developer based in Mumbai with over a decade of experience crafting apps that people actually enjoy using. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work with both product and service-based teams, building everything from large-scale consumer apps to enterprise solutions - some reaching millions of users.

I first started coding back in 2009, building apps for BlackBerry (yes, the trackball days!). Then came a brief stint experimenting with Nokia’s short-lived app platform using Qt, before finally finding my home in iOS development. Since then, I’ve worked extensively with Objective-C, Swift, and now SwiftUI, and I love exploring new Apple frameworks as they evolve.

Beyond iOS, I enjoy tinkering with Firebase, AI integrations, and creating interactive animations. I’m a big fan of Batman and can always be found rewatching Seinfeld or Supernatural when I’m not coding. If I’m not diving into a project, I’m probably watching a good K-drama, catching a movie, or spending time with family.

I occasionally take on freelance projects depending on my schedule, and I’ve been blogging on and off - first on Medium and now right here on my own site. You’ll also find me sharing iOS tutorials and animation experiments on YouTube and open-sourcing some of my projects on GitHub.
