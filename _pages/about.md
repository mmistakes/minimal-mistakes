Hi! :relaxed:. I'm Harsh Gadgil, a data scientist and software developer residing in the beautiful city of Toronto, Ontario for the foreseeable future. I blog (or, at least intend to) about data science, software development, technology and life. Welcome to my blog, feel free to look around! Oh, and in case you're wondering, [`opensorceror`](https://github.com/opensorceror) is my GitHub username.

## More About Me

I currently work as a data engineer at Bell Canada. I graduated with a masters degree in Computer Science in April 2017, specializing in Data Mining, at the [University of Guelph](http://www.uoguelph.ca/). I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Pune](http://www.unipune.ac.in/). Due to my engineering background, I'm deeply passionate about building solutions to complex problems to improve people's lives. Due to my science background, I enjoy critically reasoning about the technical nuances and empirical evaluation of such solutions.

## What I Do

I spend most of my time digging through data to find something that enables better decision making. I also frequently write code in Python, Scala and JavaScript, three of my favorite programming languages. However, I *try* to be technology agnostic - to use the best tool for the job without playing favorites.

## Interests

- *Reading*: Due to my Masters studies, I had lost touch with books for a while. A recent Kindle purchase sparked the dormant love of reading and now I'm hooked. I mostly read mystery/thriller novels. A great recent read was [A Girl on the Train](https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-mystery-thriller-books-2015) by Paula Hawkins. Due to my recent interest in creating this blog, I'm currently struggling to find time to read [The Heist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18730158-the-heist?from_search=true) by Daniel Silva. I also enjoy reading about technology and politics. Yes, I agree, [Wired](https://www.wired.com/) should stick to technology articles only.
- *Watching*: I enjoy both real science and fictional science...anything with science really. I'm an avid viewer of [PBS Spacetime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g). Matt O'Dowd explains mind-boggling physics concepts about the nature of reality in relatively easier to understand ways. One of my all time favorite space documentaries is [Cosmos - A Spacetime Odyssey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395695/) hosted by the legendary Neil deGrasse Tyson. A new favorite is [Planet Earth II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5491994/), which displays breathtaking UHD footage of wildlife on our wonderful, fragile planet.
- *Learning*: In my spare time, you can often find me cooking, traveling or watching videos on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and taking (or rather, trying to find time to take) courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
