Hi, I'm Martina. Glad you popped up here.

## The short one

I am a scientist by background and I've been working in data science/Machine Learning/AI (you name it) for a few (!) years now. I also doodle data, write about tech, data and sciency things, and share about what I learn. This blog is my lil' [public garden](https://posit.co/resources/videos/your-public-garden/). I'm not the prolific writer I aim to be, but I try.

## The longer version

My name is Martina Pugliese, I am a physicist by studies and I've been working in/with **data science** since the glorious times it was still uncool. I love **science** and have this annoying obsession towards finding quantitative explanations for things. You can read some of my thinking and scientific journey in this <a href="{{ site.url }}/crossing-the-barriers" target="_blank">old post</a>. On the side, I produce **hand-drawn data vizzes** on various topics, usually lightweight (but not just), which I share here (and there).
