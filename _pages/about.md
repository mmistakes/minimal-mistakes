# Interested in joining the lab?

Welcome to the Systems Intelligence Lab at Columbia University! We are excited to welcome passionate, creative, and collaborative individuals to join our interdisciplinary research team. We have openings at multiple levels, as listed below.

### Open Positions

#### Postdoctoral Researchers

We are actively looking for 1-2 postdoctoral researchers with a strong background in computational neuroscience, mathematics, machine learning, or related fields. Ideal candidates will have experience with electrophysiology, neuroimaging analyses, and mathematical models, and a keen interest in bridging the gap between natural and artificial intelligence by leveraging computational techniques with neurophysiological and psychophysical data.

To apply, please reach out directly to Nuttida at nr2869 [at] columbia.edu.

#### Graduate Students

We welcome applications from prospective PhD students with shared or complementary research interests. Students will have the opportunity to design and work on interdisciplinary research projects, utilizing advanced computational tools and neural recordings from our lab, ongoing collaborations, and openly available datasets.

Interested candidates should apply through the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/doctoral-program) or the [Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior (NBB)](https://www.neurosciencephd.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. Candidates applying through the NBB program should also contact Nuttida to discuss rotation opportunities.
