## What is NordIQuEst

NordIQuEst is a [NeIC](https://neic.no/) funded project with the purpose to build a Nordic-Estonian e-infrastructure which combines high-performance computing and quantum computing from across Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Estonia. Central to this is the pre-exacscale highperformance supercomputer, LUMI, located in Kajaani, Finland which will act as the hub allowing connections with existing quantum computers in Espoo, Finland and Gothenburg, Sweden. 


## Current Infrastructure

### LUMI supercomputer

The HPC hub for the NordIQuEst project, giving accessing to quantum computing resources as well as HPC resources. LUMI is the pan-European EuroHPC supercomputer. LUMI is the fastest and greenest supercomputer in Europe, hosted by CSC in Kajaani, Finland. For more information, see [https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/)


### QAL9000 quantum computer

Located at the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology at Chalmers, SE, the QAL9000 is a superconducting quantum processor, currently with 5 qubits and will operate at 20 qubits in the near future. 

### Helmi quantum computer

Helmi, the first Finnish quantum computer, is operated by VTT. Presently, Helmi provides five qubits, and will be upgraded to 20, then 50 qubits in the near future.
