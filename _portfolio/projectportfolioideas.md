* Flashforge big glass bed
* Spinlab project
* F4 tape hot end mod? IDK.. are we starting a 3DP collection? Should things be in collection "folders"?
* Solar portfolio page, gallery, "life as an installer", whatever
* Something about what do do with a pallet of Macs? Wire org, case mod, whatever
* Pretty breadboarding/proto highlights? Find that circuit from Chens lab, and the music thing from Electronics II, and maybe that homemade antenna array for the studfinder thing (theres pics and videos)
* Bot competition?
* Dog skeleton, lessons on FlashForge and high detail printing
* "Why you should join a robot club" or "why you should be a hobbyist in engineering school and not one of those kids who never learn electronics"
