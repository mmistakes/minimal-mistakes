## Introduction
Football has been a passion of mine as long as I can remember. I can vividly recall the first games of football that my brothers and I would play in the yard growing up. As the son of a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, watching football every Sunday was a ritual. Being an avid fan all my life, I have witnessed many changes to the game of football.  Some changes are good and some are bad, but most of them are necessary to keep the game alive, especially rules concerning player safety. One change that I’ve witnessed over the years is how referees call the game. Before looking at any data, it was noticeable for myself and most other fans that the referees seem to call a lot more penalties then they used to. I understand that some of this may be due to the numerous rules created to aid in player safety. However, even when I account for the new rules it seems like they are still calling fouls more frequently, ones that have been around for a long time, such as pass interference. This made me wonder: Do referees call more penalties now than they did a decade ago? If so, what penalty calls have increased the most? I decided to create a Tableau Dashboard to explore these questions. Tableau is an awesome tool to create visualizations and interactive dashboards. Using other visualization tools such as excel is bare-bones in comparison; the interactivity just isn’t there. With tableau I would be able to allow the user of my dashboard to manipulate the data to their choosing. I wanted to make sure that anyone using my dashboard would be able to see the data from any specific season in the last decade, or an average of all the seasons combined. I also wanted to make sure that they could filter the amount of calls specific to each penalty, so they can see for themselves what is being called more.
## Data Source
There are plenty of websites that have the data of NFL penalty calls. The site I chose to use was pro-football-reference.com. I chose this source because the host of my favorite sports talk show, Colin Cowherd, often references their statistics. On their website they have regular season penalty totals from past seasons. The tables include penalty called, how many times it was called, and how many penalty yards were assessed as a result. With this information, I would be able to see the amount of total penalties called each season, and see if it has increased. Also, I could see exactly which calls are being made more frequently than they used to. Unfortunately, the website did not have any downloadable data that I could import to Tableau. However, it was fairly easy for me to make my own excel spreadsheet and make my own table with their data. I inputted all of the data from the 2008 season, through week 14 of this season (2018).
## Tableau Methodology
After creating my excel document using the data from pro-football-reference, I imported my spreadsheet into Tableau. The first thing I did was look at the data to make sure everything looked correct. The only change I needed to make was to change the Season data field from a measure to date format. Once the data looked good I was ready to make some visualizations. Logically, the first one I wanted to make was a time-series line graph, showing how many total penalties have been called over the years. This was as simple as inputting the season data field in the columns box, and the total penalties called field in the rows box. I only wanted full seasons of penalty calls in this visualization, so I used a filter to leave out 2018’s data. Sure enough, the line graph shows that penalties have certainly increased overall since 2008. 
Now that I saw that penalty calls have increased significantly, I wanted to see exactly which penalties are being called more as the years have go by. Once again, a time series line graph was perfect for looking at this. I once again entered the season data field into columns, and penalties called into rows. Similarly to the first visualization, I didn’t want the incomplete 2018 to skew the data so I filtered out that season. To allow the user to see the amount of calls over the years for a specific penalty, I embedded a filter to sort by any specific penalty available in the data. I then used a filter to assign each penalty call chosen a color on the graph. I found the amount of calls made for the following penalties to have increased the most since 2008: Defensive pass interference, Illegal block above the waist, illegal use of hands, neutral zone infraction, offensive & defensive holding, roughing the passer, unnecessary roughness, and unsportsmanlike conduct. I believe this demonstrates that the calls that are being made more frequently are obviously an attempt to increase player safety. 
Once I had looked at the data from the previous 10 seasons, I wanted to see how it would compare to data from this season. I decided to create a textbox showing the amount of each penalty called so far this year. I also wanted to make a prediction of how many more penalties would be called by the end of the season. First, I made sure to filter out every other season except for 2018. For the header, I started with creating three place holders for my columns using calculated fields. I then created three more calculated fields to create strings for my table’s categories (Penalty, Calls through week 14, 2018 Prediction). For example, my calculated field for the Penalty category: ‘Penalty’. For the season end prediction, I calculated the percentage of games left in the season. The amount of games in an NFL season is 256. The amount of games played through week 14 of the 2018 season is 208. 
208/256 = .8125
 1-.8125 = .1875 % of games remaining
I created the calculated field ‘2018 Prediction’ by inputting: [total penalties called]* 1.1875
This calculation shows a prediction of how many penalties would be called by the end of the year. This table allowed me to predict how many calls will be made by the end of the season. If the prediction is correct, we will see a new all-time high in penalties called in a season. 
The second table is the same as the first one, except it shows the data from the seasons other than 2018. I also wanted to calculate the average penalty calls per year from 2008-2017, so I could compare it to the 2018 prediction as well as every other season. I created my header with the same method as the first table with the categories: Penalty, Times Called, and 2008-2017 average calls per year. I then created a parameter to allow the user of this table to view the amount of each penalty called in any season of their choosing. In my parameter, I set the date range from 2008-2017. Then I needed to create a calculated field for my parameter to be used in the visualization. I created the calculated field ‘Total Penalties Called 2008-2017’ by inputting (If [Season]= [Parameters].[Season] THEN [Total Penalties Called] END).  To calculate the average penalty calls per season from 2008-2017, I created a calculated field by inputting ( [Total Penalties Called]/10). This created an interactive table where users can select which season they want to compare with the 10 year average. It also helped conclude that more penalties are being called and it also shows which ones are above and below the ten year average.

## Data Visualization Methodology
I used the following data visualization methods that I learned from reading the textbook ‘Story Telling with Data’ by Knaflic, Cole Nussbaumer. 
Tufte’s Principles:
1.	Above all else, show the data. The focus should be on the content of the data. All of my visualizations are focused on the data with minimal clutter. The tooltips in my visualization neatly display the information pertinent to what they are viewing.

2.	Data-ink / total ink. One should maximize the data-ink ratio, within reason. I did this by trying to minimize any extra ink not important to the data. I removed any extra grid-lines and borders that were insignificant.

3.	Emphasize important data elements using color. I attempted to do this by adding color to my line graph visualizations. When looking at the penalties per season graph, the user is immediately drawn to the blue line. I also used color to distinguish between each penalty 
type in my other line graph.

Kosslyns Principles:

1.	The color scheme should be cogent and simple to understand in context of the visualized data. I tried not to use too much color so I didn’t distract from the data

2.	Understanding breaks down once too much information. Provide neither too much nor too little information. Provide neither too much nor too little information. I kept each visualization simple, but they each had plenty of information. I tried to make each visual 
answer a specific question about the data. 
## Conclusion
Through researching this data and creating visualizations in tableau I have answered my research questions. 
Do referees call more penalties now than they did a decade ago? If so, what penalty calls have increased the most?
The answer is a resounding yes. As you can see in the visualizations above, penalties have increased significantly over the last 10 seasons. The penalties that increased the most are Defensive pass interference, Illegal block above the waist, illegal use of hands, neutral zone infraction, offensive & defensive holding, roughing the passer, unnecessary roughness, and unsportsmanlike conduct. I found that the penalties being called are a result of trying to make the game safer. It may not be fun to watch a flag get thrown as much as it does in todays game, but it ultimately ensures that the game will be played forever.
