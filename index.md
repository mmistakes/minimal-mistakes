I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland's Atmospheric and
Oceanic Science department in [Dr. Jacob Wenegrat](https://wenegrat.github.io/)'s group.
My research efforts have been focused on numerical investigations of turbulent
environments in geophysical boundary layers in general (both oceanic and atmospheric).
More recently I began investigating submesoscale phenomena in the oceanic bottom boundary
layer.
