Hi! I'm a masters student in <a href="https://compling.uw.edu/">computational linguistics</a> at the <a href="https://uw.edu">University of
  Washington</a>, and  I'm broadly interested in machine learning for natural language processing. I'm currently advised by <a href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah
Smith</a>.
<br>
<br>
I'll be spending this summer as an AI resident at <a href="https://x.company/">X, the moonshot factory</a>, working on confidential projects in coding and program synthesis!

<br>
In 2021 I spent time building language + vision models on the <a
  href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a> and investigating bias in
machine learning models on the platform health team at <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I also spent a few years as a software
engineer at <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/display-video-360/">Google</a> before starting grad school.
<br>
<br>
I graduated with a B.S. in computer science from the University of Washington in 2017, where I worked with <a
  href="https://yangfengji.net/">Yangfeng Ji</a> and Noah Smith on deep learning for text pair predictions.
