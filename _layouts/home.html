Hi! I'm a <a href="https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">predoctoral researcher</a> on the
<a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>, and I'm advised by <a href="https://pdasigi.github.io/">Pradeep Dasigi</a> and <a href="https://jessedodge.github.io/">Jesse Dodge</a>.
<br>
<br>
My research generally spans machine learning and natural language processing, and I'm currently interested in improved model tuning and modularization. I'm also interested in the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, and to that end I started and currently lead AI2's public policy efforts.
<br>
<br>
I received my masters in computational linguistics and bachelors in computer science from the University of Washington, where I worked with <a
  href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/">Jungo Kasai</a> and <a
  href="https://yangfengji.net/">Yangfeng Ji</a>, and was advised by <a
  href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah Smith</a>.
<br>
<br>
I've previously worked on code & program synthesis at <a href="https://x.company/">X, the moonshot
  factory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Labs">Google Labs</a>, language + vision models at AI2, and platform health at <a
  href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I also spent a few years as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and <a
  href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/display-video-360/">Google</a>. See my
<a href="/assets/CV-Final-12.1.2023.pdf">CV</a> for more details.
