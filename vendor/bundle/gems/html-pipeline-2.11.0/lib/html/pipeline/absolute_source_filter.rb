      # through a cdn, or if the content for the page assumes the host is known
      # i.e. scraped webpages and some RSS feeds.
      #
      # Context options:
      #   :image_base_url - Base URL for image host for root relative src.
      #   :image_subpage_url - For relative src.
      #
      # This filter does not write additional information to the context.
      # This filter would need to be run before CamoFilter.
