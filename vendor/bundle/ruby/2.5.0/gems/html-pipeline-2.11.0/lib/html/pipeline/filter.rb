module HTML
  class Pipeline
    # Base class for user content HTML filters. Each filter takes an
    # HTML string or Nokogiri::HTML::DocumentFragment, performs
    # modifications and/or writes information to the result hash. Filters must
    # return a DocumentFragment (typically the same instance provided to the call
    # method) or a String with HTML markup.
    #
    # Example filter that replaces all images with trollface:
    #
    #   class FuuuFilter < HTML::Pipeline::Filter
    #     def call
    #       doc.search('img').each do |img|
    #         img['src'] = "http://paradoxdgn.com/junk/avatars/trollface.jpg"
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # The context Hash passes options to filters and should not be changed in
    # place.  A Result Hash allows filters to make extracted information
    # available to the caller and is mutable.
    #
    # Common context options:
    #   :base_url   - The site's base URL
    #   :repository - A Repository providing context for the HTML being processed
    #
    # Each filter may define additional options and output values. See the class
    # docs for more info.
