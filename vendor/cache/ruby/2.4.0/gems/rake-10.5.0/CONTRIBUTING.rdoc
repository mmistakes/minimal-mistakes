= Source Repository

Rake is currently hosted at github. The github web page is
http://github.com/ruby/rake . The public git clone URL is

  git://github.com/ruby/rake.git

= Running the Rake Test Suite

If you wish to run the unit and functional tests that come with Rake:

* +cd+ into the top project directory of rake.
* Install the +hoe+ gem dependency:

    gem install hoe # Unless the hoe gem is already installed

* Type one of the following:

    rake newb       # If you have never run rake's tests
    rake            # If you have run rake's tests

= Issues and Bug Reports

Feel free to submit commits or feature requests.  If you send a patch,
remember to update the corresponding unit tests.  In fact, I prefer
new feature to be submitted in the form of new unit tests.

For other information, feel free to ask on the ruby-talk mailing list.

If you have found a bug in rake please try with the latest version of rake
before filing an issue.  Also check History.rdoc for bug fixes that may have
addressed your issue.

When submitting pull requests please check the rake Travis-CI page for test
failures:
