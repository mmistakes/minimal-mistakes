Additions to the old CHANGES file were not made consistently so some

  your class, include Rake::DSL into the class.  The DSL is still available at
  the top level scope (via the top level object which extends Rake::DSL).

* Rake now warns when the deprecated :needs syntax used.

* Rake history is now UTF-8 encoded.

  current directory.  Patch by Alex Chaffee.

  Lüdtke

* Rake::RDocTask is deprecated.  Use RDoc::Task from RDoc 2.4.2+ (require

  environment variable.

* Errors in Rake will now display the task invocation chain in effect
  at the time of the error.

* Accepted change by warnickr to not expand test patterns in shell
  (allowing more files in the test suite).

* Fixed that file tasks did not perform prereq lookups in scope
  (Redmine #57).

=== 0.8.7

* Fixed EXEEXT for JRuby on windows.

=== 0.8.6

* Better support for the system command on Windows.

=== 0.8.4

* Preserve case when locating rakefiles (patch from James
  M. Lawrence/quix)

* Better support for windows paths in the test task (patch from Simon
  Chiang/bahuvrihi)

* Windows system dir search order is now: HOME, HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH,

  gem package task.

=== 0.8.3

* Enhanced the system directory detection in windows. We now check
  HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH and USERPROFILE if APPDATA isn't found. (Patch
  supplied by James Tucker). Rake no long aborts if it can't find the
  directory.

* Added fix to handle ruby installations in directories with spaces in
  their name.

=== 0.8.2

* Fixed bug in package task so that it will include the subdir
  directory in the package for testing. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

  attribute junk in a tar file. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

* Fixed filename dependency order bug in test_inspect_pending and
  test_to_s_pending. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

  Pratomo)

  and freeze.

* Changed RDoc test task to have no default template. This makes it
  easier for the tempate to pick up the template from the environment.

* Changed from using Mutex to Monitor. Evidently Mutex causes thread
  join errors when Ruby is compiled with -disable-pthreads. (Patch
  supplied by Ittay Dror)

* Fixed bug in makefile parser that had problems with extra spaces in
  file task names. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

* Added a performance patch for reading large makefile dependency
  files. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

  :with_defaults method. (Idea for default argument merging supplied
  by (Adam Q. Salter)

* The -T output will only self-truncate if the output is a tty.
  However, if RAKE_COLUMNS is explicitly set, it will be honored in
  any case. (Patch provided by Gavin Stark).

* Numerous fixes for running under windows. A big thanks to Bheeshmar
  Redheendran for spending a good part of the afternoon at the
  Lonestar Ruby Conference to help me work out these issues.

  from the FileUtil module.
* Added init and top_level for custom rake applications.

  Payton Quackenbush).

* The -r option will now load .rake files (but a straight require
  doesn't yet).  NOTE: This is experimental ... it may be

* Fixed file creation bug in the unit tests (caused infinite loop on
  windows).

  retrigger file tasks depending on the directory (see
  FileCreationTask and EarlyTime).
* Added egrep to FileList
* ruby command now runs same ruby version as rake.

  messages.
* Make FileUtils methods private at the top level module to avoid
  accidental method leaking into other objects.
* Added test loader option to test task.  "testrb" is no longer the
  default test loader.  It is now eating syntax errors that should
  halt the unit tests.
* Revamped FileList so that it works more like and array (addressed
  flatten bug).  Added many tests around file list.
* Added +ext+ method to both String and FileList.

=== 0.5.0

  special actions on the result of the system call.  E.g.

    sh "shell_command" do |ok, res|
      puts "Program returned #{res.exitstatus}" if ! ok
    end

=== 0.4.9

* Switched to Jamis Buck's RDoc template.

  libraries from loading while using rails.

  using the built-in test task macros because the rake runtime is no
  longer needed.

  macros.
* Allow a +test_files+ attribute in test tasks.  This allows more
  flexibility in specifying test files.

  until the first call that needs the file names.
* VAR=VALUE options are now accepted on the command line and are
  treated like environment variables.  The values may be tested in a
  Rakefile by referencing ENV['VAR'].
* File.mtime is now used (instead of File.new().mtime).

=== 0.3.2.x
