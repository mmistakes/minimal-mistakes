愿好时光中文学校是孩子们童年时最美好的一段记忆，是学习感受中国语言文化的最难忘的一段经历。

_We hope GoodTime Chinese School will be the most beautiful memory of our students' childhood and their most unforgettable experience of learning the Chinese language and cultures._

Goodtime Chinese School (GCS), is a non-profit organization registered in Oregon State. We specialize in teaching Mandarin Chinese by providing immersion programs that make learning easy and fun. We take a step-by-step approach that develops student's Chinese in listening, speaking, reading and writing . GCS also provides courses on Chinese culture in areas such as cooking and art! All levels are offered from no-knowledge of Chinese to full fluency. We also offer enrichment courses in math, writing and the arts. Our facilities include six large classrooms, a large and private preschool wing, a fully equipped computer lab, one massive art and crafts room, a Lego playroom, two kitchens, indoor and outdoor play areas and several restrooms for exclusive use.

Currently we offer a thriving preschool, a half day kindergarten, an after-school program and weekend Chinese. We also provide exciting camps for summer and winter break. All the Chinese language classes and activities are based on Chinese immersion techniques and are held by experienced teachers whose native tongue is Mandarin Chinese.

Our courses are structured around the needs of our students and their families. We offer great flexibility and personal lesson plans to meet every child's learning level. Our outstanding teachers take pride in the progress of our students as well as the success of our excellent staff.

GCS is certified by the AdvancED Accreditation Commission.
