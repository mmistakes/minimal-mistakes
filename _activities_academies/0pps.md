PPS is home to an innovative K-12 Mandarin immersion program. Beginning in kindergarten, students spend half of the school day learning in Mandarin Chinese and half of the school day learning in English, according to a 50:50 immersion model. Students in the program continue their studies in middle school with Social Studies and Chinese Language Arts taught in Mandarin. This will take approximately one third of their academic day. The high school Mandarin Immersion Program continuation offers both face-to-face and blended online courses that incorporate language and content-based instruction. The amount of time per week that students spend learning in Chinese depends on their course selections.
