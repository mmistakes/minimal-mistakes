# Teaching 

During my PhD studies, I have worked as a teaching assistant and delivered tutorials on quantitative and qualitative methods (L2305: Research Methods for Political Scientists) and introduction to political science (L2102: Politics 1a and L2103: Politics 1b). 



    
  ## Undergraduate level

- Žuffová, Mária. "Do FOI laws and open government data deliver as anti-corruption policies? Evidence from a cross- country study." (under review at Government Information Quarterly)



As a postdoc, I look forward to teaching a substantive course on media and democracy, digital technologies and politics, or government transparency. Using different pedagogical approaches and practices, I strive for enabling active learning and creating an inclusive environment which reflects students’ individual needs and limitations and gives them equal chances to engage. I aim to design substantive courses to encourage discussions and include hands-on experience with software or programming language in methods classes, as these approaches helped me as a student to learn most effectively.
