  <strong>Strings of Memory</strong> is a small digital archive dedicated to the music that runs through my family. 
  From my grandfather and his brothers playing corridos and mariachi at every family gathering, to my dad’s university 
  mariachi days, to my own journey with violin, harp, guitar, corridos tumbados, and huapangos, this site collects 
  stories, photos, and sounds that have shaped who I am.

  This project was created for the Code in Context course at the University of Notre Dame using the Jekyll static site 
  framework and the Minimal Mistakes theme. It’s part family tribute, part musical scrapbook, and part experiment in 
  digital storytelling.
