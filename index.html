I am a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://abbasilab.org/">University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)</a> working on Functional modeling in brain. Previously, I was a postdoc researcher at <a href="http://kordinglab.com/">University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)</a> where my research focused on theory of deep learning and geometrical structure of neurons. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran where I studied computational neuroscience. My research focused on developing interpertable machine learning to relate function and strcture of brain.
