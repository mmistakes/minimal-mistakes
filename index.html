<p>
I like words, both <a href="/words/">writing</a> and <a href="/reads/">reading</a> them.
</p>

<p>
I like learning, understanding that the more I learn the more I realize I don't know.
</p>

<p>
I like technology, having seen it open up endless possibilities for a nerd like me.
</p>

<p>
I like to be inclusive, and realize the importance of <a href="/allyship/">playing a role</a>.
