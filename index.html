<p>This page is for anyone who works with young children and who would like to explore maths through familiar objects and ideas. Some articles are very specific to a particular activity (for example 'counting milk') or connection (like 'triangles in construction'), and others are there to give some more general maths background (such as 'symmetry' or 'angles').</p>

<p>If you want to browse, you could have a look at these most recent articles. If you would like to find maths ideas relating to something specific, then the topic filter under 'all articles' might be more helpful.</p>

<p>We hope you find this website useful! If you have any feedback, please feel free to email r.h.oughton [at] durham.ac.uk.
We'd also love to see these ideas being used in practice - if you're able to share, please use the hashtag #YMBMwebsite.</p>
