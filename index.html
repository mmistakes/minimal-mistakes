<p>
I like words. When I call myself a wordsmith, it's tongue in cheek. With 
everything in life, the more I learn the more I realize I don't know. I'm 
a lifelong learner and writing is one of my lifelong passions.
</p>

<p>
I like technology. Being a geek and nerd is a reality for me. Those titles 
involve way more than just technology, but technology has helped 
make them cool and, not to mention, full of possibilities.
