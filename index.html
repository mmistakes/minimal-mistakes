I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor Konrad Kording. On the spare time, I play piano , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roozbehfarhoodi/">what I'm practicing now</a> and read books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50136496-roozbeh-farhoodi">what I'm reading now</a>.
