# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# To upgrade, run `bundle update`.

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"

# If you have any plugins, put them here!

  gem "jekyll-paginate"
  gem "jekyll-sitemap"
