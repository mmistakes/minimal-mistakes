My my main job still remains a development job, but I took an interest in the processes more than the code and I was
able to pursue it.

I am now helping the Scrum Master setting up meetings, making sure we stay focus on the agenda and have actionable items
at the end.
<br/>
I am also involved in the reshaping of our Support team and process, which I am enjoying.
As such we are currently reviewing the aim of having a dedicated Support team, the type of tickets to assign to
it, rather than to one of the existing teams, the composition of such a team, etc.
