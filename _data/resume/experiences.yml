  role: "Backend Team Lead / Senior Laravel Developer"
  time: "October 2021 - April 2024"
  company: CareLineLive, London
  details: "
<p>I joined CareLineLive as a Senior Laravel Developer, but after a few months I was offered the opportunity to line
manage a small team of two backend developers, along my other responsibilities as developer. I accepted because
that was, and still is, the role I see myself into at this time in my career.
</p>
<p>In my role as a developer I was heavily involved high-level analysis, technical design, and of course implementation.
But I would also manage the Jira tickets, creating them, making sure they were groomed and ready for development,
helping clearing blockers, etc.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of my role as developer which I really enjoyed was mentoring. I was able to use my experience to guide
the other developers, learn from my mistake, and grow as professionals.
</p>
<p>But for the last year and a half I was also a line manager. This was new to me, but something I was looking forward to
try doing. My responsibilities were probably the usual ones expected from a line manager: conducting quarter reviews,
setting up objectives, making sure absence were recorded, etc. I also took an active part in recruiting our latest
developer by reviewing the applications, and setting up and be part of the interviewing process.
