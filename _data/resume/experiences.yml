  role: "Senior Laravel Developer / Backend Team Lead"
  time: "October 2021 - April 2024"
  company: CareLineLive, London
  details: "
  <p>I joined CareLineLive as a Senior Laravel Developer, but after a few months I was offered the opportunity to line
  manage a small team of two backend developers, along my other responsibilities as developer. I accepted because
  that was, and still is, the role I see myself into at this time in my career.
  </p>
  <p>In my role as a developer I was heavily involved high-level analysis, technical design, and of course implementation.
  But I would also manage the Jira tickets, creating them, making sure they were groomed and ready for development,
  helping clearing blockers, etc.
  </p>
  <p>Another aspect of my role as developer which I really enjoyed was mentoring. I was able to use my experience to guide
  the other developers, learn from my mistake, and grow as professionals.
  </p>
  <p>But for the last year and a half I was also a line manager. This was new to me, but something I was looking forward to
  try doing. My responsibilities were probably the usual ones expected from a line manager: conducting quarter reviews,
  setting up objectives, making sure absence were recorded, etc. I also took an active part in recruiting our latest
  developer by reviewing the applications, and setting up and be part of the interviewing process.

  time: October 2020 - October 2021
  company: Bumble, London
  details: "
  <p>My experience at Bumble has been quite different. Due to their tech-stack and code practices, and the cultural
  shift at Bumble, I didn't really learn much from a technical point of view.
  </p>
  <p>They were however on a journey to Agile, and I was able to introduce retrospective meetings which were very much
  welcomed.

  role: Applications Developer
  time: October 2018 - October 2020
  company: Shopworks, London
  details: "
  <p>As a developer I was introduced to DDD, which I found intriguing and thought provoking, GitLab pipelines for CI, and
  Continuous Deployment. We were deploying every day (no Fridays of course), which resulted in faster bug fixing and
  increased customer satisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>Other achievements I am proud of include being able to work on coding standard, and how to enforce them (with local
  tools and CI pipelines), and creating an integration with a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party HR system. 
  </p>
  <p>I was also able to expand on my knowledge of Agile, and Scrum in particular, by shadowing the Scrum master.
  I get the aversion many people have around the Scrum ceremonies, but I do believe the Agile methodology is one of the
  best that came out in a long time.
  </p>
  <p>In my last six months, I was involved with our Support Team, which was responsible for some of our biggest clients.
  I was tasked with helping smoothing the relationship between them and the development team. It was challenging, but
  by taking small steps and clearly explaining the reasoning behind each of them and how they could help, I was able
  to decrease the ticket resolution time by 10%. The clients were also better informed on the activity of their tickets
  which resulted in a reduction of 20% of duplicate tickets raised.

  details: "
  <p>The web team was mainly responsible for the in-house CMS and the website. During my time we migrated from Laravel 4.2
  to 5.2, but thanks to very comprehensive test suites, it went smoothly. I will never underestimate the importance of
  tests.
  </p>
  <p>I also wrote many RESTful APIs, in Lumen, for a SPA. This was the first time I used a Design First approach,
