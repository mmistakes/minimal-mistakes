Often treated as a backyard sport in the US, Badminton doesn’t get the media exposure rendered to baseball, basketball and other professional sports. Yet, it is the world's fastest and most demanding racquet sport. It requires strength, speed, agility, coordination, strategy, concentration, and teamwork (for doubles).

At Oregon Badminton Academy, we are a team of badminton fanatics aiming to build a state-of-art facility for both pros and amateurs. We strive to bring awareness, and raise the popularity of this wonderful sport to this great city of diversity that encompasses endless possibility. We welcome players of all ages and levels to come play, learn, socialize and just have fun. So whether you are a beginner, a pro, or somewhere in-between OBA is for you.
