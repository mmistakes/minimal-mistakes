It is located in Northwest Portland at 1425 NW 16th Avenue. As a part of the Qian Kun Institute, we offer in-depth, professional training in Chinese Wushu (Kung Fu), Taijiquan (Tai Chi) and Qigong.

Our Center operates Monday through Saturday and schedules classes for students of all ages at all levels of proficiency, from complete beginners seeking ways to improve their health to advanced students seeking competition-level instruction.

Students at the U.S. Wushu Center pay a monthly fee which entitles them to attend appropriate-level classes as frequently as they wish. We recommend that students attend at least two classes per week in order to keep up with instruction. Discounted fees are available for couples and families.

Our facilities include expansive training and performance areas, changing rooms, all in a full-sized gym — our Pearl Court. Our facility also provides classrooms for our After School Programs and our Language & Arts Center classes and events.
