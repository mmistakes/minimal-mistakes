# [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

:sparkles: See what's new in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

**Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and must be retained in the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll encounter `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build.

## Installation

There are three ways to install: as a [gem-based theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes), as a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) (GitHub Pages compatible), or forking/directly copying all of the theme files into your project.

### Gem-based method

With Gem-based themes, directories such as the `assets`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. Yet all of the necessary directories will be read and processed during Jekyll’s build process.

This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files. To install:

1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
   ```

2. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) command:

   ```bash
   bundle
   ```

3. Set the `theme` in your project's Jekyll `_config.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll
   ```

To update the theme run `bundle update`.

### Remote theme method

Remote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require `Gemfile` changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages.

To install:

1. Create/replace the contents of your `Gemfile` with the following:

   ```ruby
   source "https://rubygems.org"

   gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
   gem "jekyll-include-cache", group: :jekyll_plugins
   ```

2. Add `jekyll-include-cache` to the `plugins` array of your `_config.yml`.

3. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) command:

   ```bash
   bundle
   ```

4. Add `remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.26.1"` to your `_config.yml` file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entry.

<!--
  Dev note: The version number is currently hard-coded in these files:

    - package.json
    - README.md (this file)
    - docs/_data/theme.yml
    - docs/_pages/home.md (in Front Matter "excerpt")

  `package.json` holds the authoritative version number, and the others can be updated with `bundle exec rake version`.

  The following files should also be regenerated:

    - _includes/copyright.html, _includes/copyright.js, _sass/minimal-mistakes/_copyright.scss
      (Run `bundle exec rake clean` then `bundle exec rake copyright` - all three references `package.json`)
    - assets/js/main.min.js (Run `bundle exec rake js`, references `_includes/copyright.js`)

  *Tip*: The default Rake task will update all of the above files at once.

  Additionally, the license year is hard-coded in these files and are NOT covered by a Rake task:

    - README.md (this file, near the end)
    - LICENSE
-->

**Looking for an example?** Use the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) for the quickest method of getting a GitHub Pages hosted site up and running. Generate a new repository from the starter, replace sample content with your own, and configure as needed.

## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add/migrate content, and more read the [theme's documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

## Contributing

Found a typo in the documentation or interested in [fixing a bug](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

For help with using the theme or general Jekyll support questions, please use the [Jekyll Talk forums](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/).

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`).
3. Open a pull request on GitHub and describe the feature or fix.

Theme documentation and demo pages can be found in the [`/docs`](docs) if submitting improvements, typo corrections, etc.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test the theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/test/`. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
