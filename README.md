## Edits or contributions

PRs are, shockingly, accepted by people unaffiliated with LP, at least in theory. If you are adding or editing or co-authoring a blog post, for example, it might help to preview your work locally by cloning, then installing `bundler`, then running

```
bundler install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
