## About the Garden

Lan Su Chinese Garden is one of Portland's greatest treasures and most interesting sites to see while visiting Portland. A result of a collaboration between the cities of Portland and Suzhou, our sister city in China's Jiangsu province that's famous for its beautiful Ming Dynasty gardens, Lan Su was built by Chinese artisans from our Suzhou and is one the most authentic Chinese gardens outside of China.

Much more than just a beautiful botanical garden, Lan Su is a creative wonder -- a powerfully inspiring experience based on a 2,000-year-old Chinese tradition that melds art, architecture, design and nature in perfect harmony.

Once inside the garden's walls, you'll feel as if you've traveled through time to another era in a faraway world. Lan Su is a window into Chinese culture, history and way of thinking. Ever changing, Lan Su always has something new to offer - by the minute, by the hour, and with the seasons. Enter the wonderland.

## Our Name

The garden's name represents this relationship: sounds from both Portland and Suzhou are combined to form Lan Su. "Lan" (蘭) is also the Chinese word for "Orchid" and "Su" (蘇) is the word for "Arise" or "Awaken," so the garden's name can also be interpreted poetically as "Garden of Awakening Orchids." (蘭蘇園)
