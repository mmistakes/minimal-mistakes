Over the past few years, our team has been working on a few interrelated research projects about the work of maintaining Free & Open-Source Software (FOSS) projects. For more information about our project, read [this blog post](https://stuartgeiger.com/posts/2019/01/digital-infrastructure-grant/) we wrote when we first received our research grant from the Ford & Sloan Foundations. Our team is an interdisciplinary mix tackling these issues from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, and many of us have also been maintainers of various FOSS projects:

# Publications

We're working on a few different papers at the moment, but you can read this earlier paper from some of our team about a related topic: documentation in FOSS:
