## Projects  
- **VLM Hallucination Mitigation**
Trained lightweight probing-head MLPs across decoder layers to perform per-token hallucination scoring, leveraging
hidden-state representations from Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InternVL-2.5.
Built on a dynamic rollback decoder by adding multimodal guidance, using sliding-window triggers, candidate regeneration, and a verification-penalty scoring function for consistent hallucination suppression.
- **Learning Hierarchical Image Segmentation For Recognition and By Recognition**
Extended the CAST model (SOTA) to incorporate monocular depth estimation hierarchically, enabling depth-guided
Superpixels Generation for improved Segmentation & Recognition accuracy on datasets like
Conducted detailed ablation studies comparing RGB-only vs. depth-fused features, evaluating performance with mIoU,
edge F1-score, and region consistency metrics across varied visual domains.
- **Low Light Image Enhancement**  
Utilized Pixel Attention and RDCA mechanisms for transforming a low light noisy image, to a visually HD lit image.
- **2D to 3D Reconstruction & AR Visualisation**
Utilized the Deep Convolutional Conditional GAN's to generate 3D Meshes using 2D images, and deployed the 3D model object in AR space using Homography.
- **LORA Learns less and Forgets less**
Built an experimental pipeline to compare full vs. LoRA fine-tuning on GLUE for task adaptation and forgetting analysis.
- **0.04 Percent - Decentralized AI-Powered Carbon Market**
Built a decentralized carbon credit system using ERC-20 smart contracts, ensuring transparency, fraud prevention, and
standardized pricing for reforestation projects
- **Neural Style Transfer**
Developed a Neural Style Transfer pipeline using VGG19, extracting multi-layer features for high-quality stylization.
