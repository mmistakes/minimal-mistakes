## Projects

- **GANalyse: Profiling & Optimization Framework for DL Architectures**
  Developed a PyTorch Profiler-based analysis pipeline for architecture-specific optimization, using ResNet as baseline. Cross-verified profiler metrics with literature to automate failure detection and evidence-based tuning. _(DSG, IIT Roorkee, 2024–Present)_

- **2D to 3D Modeling using Deep Learning**
  Designed a deep learning pipeline to reconstruct 3D CAD models from 2D engineering drawings, integrating CNN-based shape estimation with SolidWorks API via VBA scripting. _(MIED Department, IIT Roorkee, 2025)_

- **Sirius: Multi-Retrieval RAG System for Financial and Legal Docs**
  Developed AI agents using Corrective RAG (CRAG) and PlanRAG. Integrated HyDE to enhance dense zero-shot retrieval and evaluated multi-retrieval pipelines on financial QA tasks. _(Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0, IIT Bombay, 2024)_

- **Knowledge Graph Embeddings for RAG LLMs**
  Created a unified image-text knowledge graph using CLIP/USE embeddings and dimensionality reduction (UMAP, t-SNE, PCA). Integrated KGE to improve RAG model context. _(DSG, IIT Roorkee, 2024)_

- **StyleUp: GenZ Fashion Design Platform**
  Built a creative design app using Neural Style Transfer and DALL·E to generate wearable art. Streamlit-based app ranked in top 4% at Myntra HackerRamp. _(Myntra Hackerramp: WeForShe 2024)_

- **Tech-Enhanced AI Interview Learning Platform**
  Built an AI-driven platform generating context-specific interview questions using ML models. Integrated Google Speech Recognition to capture and assess spoken responses. Web-scraped dynamic datasets to deepen conversational relevance. _(Techshila, Inter Bhawan Tech Meet, IIT Roorkee, 2024)_

- **Dynamic Adaptation of Digital Workspace**
  Designed an adaptive model using Random Forest and Windows API to optimize system resources based on user eye movement and activity. _(DSG's Bring Your Own Project, IIT Roorkee, 2023)_
