## Projects  
- **Voice Cloning**  
  Developed automated voice clones using Tortoise-TTS with a Streamlit application for real-time custom voice generation.
- **ForecastPro**  
  A time series forecasting package implementing SOTA deep learning models (LSTNet) and statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMAX) with evaluations on UCI and Yahoo Finance datasets.
- **GANs vs Mixture Models**  
  Comparative analysis of different approaches to image generation using DCGAN, WGAN, and GMMs with Expectation Maximization, finding GMM-generated images were more diverse but lacked GAN sharpness.

- **Portfolio Optimization**  
  Implemented multi-risk measure optimization on S&P-500 stocks using Sharpe ratio and Monte Carlo simulation for forecasting portfolio returns.
