## Problem
Roadmap thrash, missed dates, low confidence.

## Approach
- One-page strategy + 90-day plan
- Weekly exec cadence + portfolio board
- KPI reset (flow, quality, value)

## Outcome
- Lead time materially reduced within 90 days
- Commit-to-deploy improved
- Churn drivers addressed with cross-functional fixes
