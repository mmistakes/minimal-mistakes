Our church is a group of believing followers of Jesus Christ gathering locally here in Corvallis Oregon to worship, fellowship and disciple. We are a non-denominational independent church embracing all walks of emphasis in the Christian faith, based solely on Bible.

Our mission and vision of the church is to reach and evangelize the un-churched people in the OSU campus and our local community, to bring them to faith in Jesus Christ, through worship, discipleship and fellowship grow the relationship with our Heavenly Father. Our goal is to build up the believers to Christ-like maturity, equip them for different ministry in the church, and to send them as witnesses to the world for the glory of God as Christ has commanded us in the Great Commission.
