The firmware for the Libre Solar hardware is developed using the [ARM mbed OS](https://developer.mbed.org/) embedded software framework. This makes it possible to use easy-to understand C++ syntax (similar to Arduino) and enhances community based software development.

The current versions of the firmware can be found on the [LibreSolar GitHub page](https://github.com/LibreSolar).

A manual how to connect a programmer to the standard 9-pin Cortex adapter on the Libre Solar hardware will be published soon.
