We focus on three universal scenarios. Each pairs **Problem → Impact → Fix** with a fast path to action.

## <a id="not-growing"></a>1) Not growing but want to
**Problem:** Momentum plateau; unclear priorities.  
**Impact:** Missed targets, stall in pipeline/NPS/NRR.  
**Fix:** 6-week focus reset—single plan, OKRs, cadence, dashboard.

## <a id="scaling"></a>2) Growing and need to scale

**Offer:** [Run the readiness check →](/resources/#readiness-check)

## <a id="profitability"></a>3) Revenue but not profitable

**Impact:** Flat margin, anxious boardroom.  
**Fix:** KPI reset, cost-to-value mapping, finance–ops cadence, vendor optimization.
